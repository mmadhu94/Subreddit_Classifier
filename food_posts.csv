This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking at maybe going all in on the currently running Pearlbrook expansion Kickstarter fundraiser and get Everdell and the expansion. That said, I like to do my research, and while I read a lot of ebullient, simplistic reviews and listened to a few uncritical podcast epsodes, the review by these guys (Mile High Game Guys) left me with some doubts as to whether the game is more hype than long-term substance and has some real flaws.

The reviewers raised the following points:
- Unreliable chaining of creatures and buildings that doesn't help (unlike chaining in 7 Wonders, which while still a gamble, is much less costly if it fails to achieve
- Too much luck in achieving requirements of the major Event cards
- Interesting mechanics haphazardly thrown together without any real synergies.
- Too random a card draw which makes the game overall too random as the card draws are the meat of this essentially tableau-building game.
- Can go on a little long, even without new people or AP-prone people
- Tree is gimmicky and is in the way of player, blocking sight of potentially useful card.
- Too feeble worker placement action
- Player performance lives or dies based on the luck of deck draws.

On a side note, not that i want that to be the focus of discussion, but I am interested in Viticulture EE and Tuscany EE, which I think I'll like based on my experience of Troyes, a relatively similar game, mechanically speaking.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

You'll need a printer that can handle double-sided printing for the print-and-play cards, but they're specially formatted to work in black and white. 

We recommend printing the cards themselves on basic cardstock, and the Investigator form on regular printer paper. We've included a version of the VK-82S that allows players to circle a verdict rather than stamp the form. Each sheet contains three forms; a single play session usually uses ten to twenty forms.

Finally... this is an opportunity for us to do some large-scale blind playtesting of the cards themselves. We know the framework of the game is solid, but we don't have as much data on the individual cards as we'd like. When you finish a round and someone else cycles in to play, it would be great if you could pull out your phone and give us some details about how your playtest went!

&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#39;ll need a printer that can handle double-sided printing for the print-and-play cards, but they&amp;#39;re specially formatted to work in black and white. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We recommend printing the cards themselves on basic cardstock, and the Investigator form on regular printer paper. We&amp;#39;ve included a version of the VK-82S that allows players to circle a verdict rather than stamp the form. Each sheet contains three forms; a single play session usually uses ten to twenty forms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally... this is an opportunity for us to do some large-scale blind playtesting of the cards themselves. We know the framework of the game is solid, but we don&amp;#39;t have as much data on the individual cards as we&amp;#39;d like. When you finish a round and someone else cycles in to play, it would be great if you could pull out your phone and give us some details about how your playtest went!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FiUATGD-M4W3YH4L-_QsxinZs_dBkQkmhgrSfEsAyNA/viewform?ts=5ba3f4cf&amp;amp;edit_requested=true""&gt;https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1FiUATGD-M4W3YH4L-_QsxinZs_dBkQkmhgrSfEsAyNA/viewform?ts=5ba3f4cf&amp;amp;edit_requested=true&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy the rest of the weekend, and if you&amp;#39;re excited about the print-and-play release, let your friends know! We&amp;#39;d love to get to $125K this week so we can release even more of the game into the world.&lt;/p&gt;

If you own the base game, but, like my friends and I, felt it was kind of hard to lose, this expansion is for you. 

The expansion comes with lots of new playable characters and two new locations. There are also a few new mechanics and the ability for a player to play as the Queen. 

The reason to buy this expansion, though, is that it comes with a hardcore version of all of the objectives and locations from the base game as well as for the new ones. This expansion also changes the rules slightly to ramp up difficulty, along with including more difficult enemies and more vicious strikes.

Tl;dr- If you think the base game is too easy, buy the expansion. If you don’t,  it’s still worth the purchase. 

Edit: You guys are making me paranoid about what rule we could be messing up. Any ideas on what we could be missing? We learned how cards activate/ when they can, and how coordinating worked. Those were the two rules we initially messed up. Felt like everything else was straightforward. In any case, still worth the purchase even if the game is hard.

It seems to me that many of the most popular gateway games often make use of a very satisfying interaction that doesn't often get recognized.  Namely, that players are able to influence the game in such a manner that they are able to permanently benefit from their opponents for the rest of the game, and their opponents are often incentivized to benefit them.  For example, in Monopoly this manifests as paying rent to players who have purchased a property before they landed on it.  In Catan, players are more likely to trade with you if you build a city next to a desirable resource.  In 7 Wonders, players must pay their opponents for access to cleverly selected resources.  In Lords of Waterdeep, players receive benefits when their opponents use buildings that they have built, rewarding properly reading the board and their opponents.

I think what is so satisfying about this mechanic is that it forces players to give you something, and allows you to cleverly manipulate the board to encourage them to do so, thus driving regular player interaction and giving players the feeling of outplaying each other head-to-head without ever requiring direct conflict or ""take that"" mechanics.  It is directly competitive and can be clearly pre-meditated without being overtly mean, which is a level of interaction that I think non-gamers are drawn to before they get a greater sense of appreciation for all of the facets that go into board game design. It also results in players receiving physical rewards for their clever play, which serves to amplify the feeling of satisfaction that they experience.

Now, the reason I mention this is because, while I find most of the games I have listed above to be good games, I don't really want any of them in my collection.  Monopoly is a chore.  Catan takes too long for what it is.  7 Wonders is a great game that I personally find a bit bland.  Lords of Waterdeep is really cool, but it can be difficult to convince non-gamers to play it because of the theme, and a lot of people find the cube pushing to be immersion-breaking (I personally don't find it to be an issue because the game and art is so strong).

So, I basically want to ask two questions.  1.  Is there a name for the mechanism/interaction I have described above?  I can only describe it as piggybacking, but I can't use that to search for game son BGG.  2.  Can anyone recommend games that feature this that are not heavier economic games?

&gt;There's a good board game buried deep beneath this finicky city-builder.

\[snip\]

&gt;The graphic design is weirdly anonymous. The base map is practically featureless beyond the four types of building zones; the road tiles are all generic eight-point crossroads, giving the city a tepid otherworldliness as more unnatural thoroughfares are placed; and the building tiles—which I’m sure are faithful representations of *Gloomhaven* locations and will bring the joy of recognition to its players—just look bland. The character art is nice, mind you, and the *Gloomhaven* mythos is fairly imaginative; there’s just an odd disconnect between this game and the rich world it lives in.  
&gt;  
&gt;The iconography, however, is baffling in the extreme. Some of the resource icons are obvious, such as food, jewellery, and cattle. But the icons for knowledge, government, or machinery are not obvious at all, and in the melee of logistical optimization and competing game mechanics, it becomes hard to remember that you’re connecting tangible commodities rather than abstract icons which generate newer, more powerful icons. This isn’t a mechanical problem, but the more you abstract a game from its setting, the less it all means to the average player—and the more it feels like you’re rattling around a two-dimensional Rubik’s Cube.  
&gt;  
&gt;Matters are not helped by the races, which might again be tremendously thematic for the average *Gloomhaven* player but which feel completely divorced from anything that anyone else might know. They each have a racial power (read: some minor rule-breaking ability), but without knowledge of what makes a Quatryl different from a Valrath, it’s just another kink in the algorithm. Even the humans, with their power to gain additional voting influence, feel pretty same-y with all the other races. (And this is after a Kickstarter stretch goal introduced custom meeples for each race, all in different shapes and colors. But because the actual game piece barely does anything, and because they’re tiny little wooden cut-outs, little gameplay difference is made, again.)  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s also the weirdest little ""legacy"" aspect in the box: the first person to win a game, once a few games have been played and everyone is comfortable, gets to name some of the game areas, writing them on a little card—and then that’s what they’re called in perpetuity. It doesn’t change anything about later games, and there’s no extra stuff added. Maybe that’s fun for *Gloomhaven* completionists, but it’s a weird addition for the rest of us.  
&gt;  
&gt;As is often the case, a game designed for one to four players is at its best with four. It doesn’t work that well with two, but the puzzle presented by the solitaire version unexpectedly shines—and I say this as someone who hates one-player games. It’s a cunning puzzle; each move matters and careful planning is vital.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Founders of Gloomhaven* is simultaneously too complex and too abstract, too stuffed with ideas and too divorced from the richness of its own setting, to be truly recommended. (Oh, and the rules are positively *begging* to be properly copyedited.)  
&gt;  
&gt;At its heart lurks a satisfying game of supply chain logistics skinned with a kind of city constructor, but it’s finicky to learn and complicated to play. The core loop of the game is elegant enough, but it never quite feels like its own thing, and the melange of additional (and unnecessary) rules makes it hard to teach and easy to mess up.

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of Elliott over at [Legendesque](https://legendesque.com). Legendesque is an online card and board game store that offers free shipping in the US at $100, or $6 flat-rate shipping on all other orders.

Legendesque has generously donated the following prizes:

* A copy of **First Martians** (this is the pre-order version with washed/painted minis)
* A copy of **Brass:Birmingham** 
* A copy of **Colosseum**
* A copy of **5 Minute Marvel**
* A copy of **Fabled Fruit**
* A copy of **Takenoko**

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What is your all-time favorite game component, either because of its role in the gameplay, or just because it’s a cool bit of bling?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship to the US ONLY.

##The fine print

These giveaways are open until 5:30 a.m. Pacific time the day after they are posted. Comments made after 5:30 a.m. will not be eligible to win. Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Previous giveaway winners are not eligible to win additional giveaways. Anyone caught attempting to game the system by leaving multiple comments in a single post will be disqualified from this and all subsequent giveaways. 

If you’re eligible for two giveaways in a single day, you may enter both, though we ask you to consider your level of interest in the specific prizes before doing so, out of consideration for those who may be eligible for only one giveaway.

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate, everyone who replied to our solicitations for donations was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the companies providing prizes for these giveaways.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

The guy has offered me a refund, but I thought I'd ask around first and try and find one. It seems a shame to bin an otherwise perfectly decent copy over a single missing piece. 

Does anyone have, or know someone who has, an old, beat up copy they're looking to get rid of for cheap? Or maybe you can think of another way to replace a missing card? Open to suggestions.

Cheers for your help.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi all,&lt;/p&gt;

As most questions the answer depends on several factors such as budget, quality or personal preference. I sleeve pretty much all my games and I've tried a couple of brands. Hopefully my experiences will help others make a more informed decision.

**Note**: in order to make a price comparison simpler at a glance I am listing the price per 100 sleeves, even though some brands only sell packs of 50. 

Name | Mini-review | Microns | Price (100 sleeves) | Price Quality
---|---|----|----|----
Penny sleeves, mayday standard, etc | These sleeves are terrible. They are very loose on the cards, come out when shuffling, split often and have bad quality. They're cheap but you get what you paid for.  | &lt;= 40| 1-2€ |  ★☆☆☆☆
KMC perfect fit | These sleeves are typically used for double sleeving but if you're on a budget these are probably your best option. The sleeves are very fit to the card and don't add much volume. They are leagues ahead the penny sleeves, typically cost twice as much. Sometimes it's hard to find them on the cheap, I would recommend something else if you are gonna pay 4+ euros per pack | 45 | 2-4€ | ★★☆☆☆
Mayday Premium | These are my typical go-to sleeves. You can get them pretty much anywhere and they'll get the job done. The cards sit comfortably on the sleeve, the thickness is good enough. Shuffle feel is a bit ""rocky"" but it's okay. Some people complain about size consistency issues, personally never experienced them or noticed them. | 90 | 4-6€ | ★★★☆☆
Fantasy Flight  Games | These pretty much like the Mayday Premium, though they are a bit thicker. They tend to be slightly more expensive and they honestly feel the same to me so I tend to get Maydays instead. | 105 | 4-7€ | ★★★☆☆
Arcane Tinmen | Some people say these sleeves have a great quality so I'm leaning to assume I got a ""standard"" version instead of a premium version. I tried their matte sleeves and they were terrible. Card wouldn't stay in the sleeve, like a penny sleeve. Wouldn't recommend that particular pack, maybe there's a Premium version? | 80 | 4-6€ | ★☆☆☆☆
Ultra Pro | This brand makes a point of sticking an obnoxious hologram on their sleeves. I don't wanna put the hologram on the back of the card because that will mark it, I don't wanna put the hologram on the front of the card because it will get in the way. Seriously makes me avoid this brand as a whole. The sleeves are of similar quality to FFG, with same advantages and disadvantages + a hologram | 100? | 4-6€ | ★★★☆☆
Dragon Shield Matte | It's very rare to find Matte transparent sleeves and I absolutely love Matte sleeves. It has a slightly ""rugged"" back which improves card grip (also makes it unsuitable for double-sided cards). These are by far my favorite sleeves right now, very thick, super solid quality, matte back, great shuffle feel. The one problem is price but you get what you paid for the quality is fantastic AND IT'S MATTE!  | 120 | 8€ | ★★★★☆
Dragon Shield | Dragon shield also carries a non-matte version. These are also of superior quality, I like to use them for double-sided cards such as cheat sheets. Again, very thick, super solid quality, great shuffle feel, price is unfortunately the problem. | 120 | 8€ | ★★★★☆
KMC Hyper Mat Translucent | I love the Dragon Shield Matte but the high price point made me try other brands, especially when a game has a lot of cards. KMC Hyper mat are an excellent alternative AND MATTE. I think these the absolute best price/quality sleeves. They provided a matte back, great shuffle feel, quality sleeves, no size inconsistencies. The shuffle feel is even better than dragon shield's. The one problem is getting them, especially in Europe. I ordered them from japan at 2.5 euros per 80, most stores charge double... | ?? | 3-7€ | ★★★★★

If you were hoping to find non-transparent sleeves I will point you the Tolarian Community College's youtube which has an excellent and exhaustive evaluation of pretty much every brand. [This is probably the video you're looking for!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfcERas1WXI).

If you're trying to check sleeve size and/or quantity for you game check:

- [The BGG sleeve geeklist](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/164572/card-sleeve-sizes-games), the most compreensive sleeving size reference

- [Sleeve your games website](https://www.sleeveyourgames.com/), which is less compreensive but more convenient to search for.

This list is obviously incomplete, I'd like to try some other brands such as ultimate guard and swan pan. This is just a small reference guide.

I purchased Clank A Deck-Building Adventure from Amazon (shipped and sold by Amazon) some time ago and after opening the box a few items caught my eye and I was under the impression I received a counterfeit due to receiving a scratched board, and spotting a few grammer errors in the manual.


After hearing so much wonderful news about board game customer service, and how great they are, I decided to reach out to customer support instead of returning the item to Amazon. 


Originally customer support went fine and followed a standard process which I was happy with. They asked some questions and I answered them and we came to the conclusion that what I believed to be grammer errors were in fact correct and a mistake in my original reading of the manual. They agreed to replace the dull scratched board with a new one as that must have been a manufacturing defect. 


Great I thought. I'm new to boardgaming and got a nostalgic itch after browsing target and purchasing a couple of games in which the family and I had a blast. I had so much fun I went and purchased about 40 different board games (overboard I know, but couldn't resist. Some games still sit unplayed) from different publishers after researching games at BGG. We now have a weekly board game night at home, and play any other chance we get. One thing I discovered is any game over a 2 in weight is a no go for my group. Thankfully games I purchased above that can be played solo or with at least 2 players.


A handful of games (or expansions) I purchased unfortunately came with a manufacturing defect. I reached out to each individual publisher to rectify the issue and all have been great. All responded quickly and sent replacement components in a timely manner. Their process was quick and simple with no hassles. Some I just explained the issue, others wanted pictures or a more detailed description. Best customer service I've received in a while and from different publishers. I couldn't believe it.


Except for Renegade Game Studios. They agreed to send the board and had all my info so I sat waiting patiently. After not receiving the replacement I followed up requesting an update or tracking number. This email has gone unanswered and I feel I will not receive a replacement and am being ignored. That said, it's possible my ticket was accidentally closed before shipping and my follow-up email was caught in a spam filter. They might have great customer support and I just fell through the cracks. 


During the wait we played Clank and loved it. Board wasn't in the best state but functional. I was highly considering the expansions, and In! Space! for something a little different, but before I dive in I would love to know your experience with the company. As much as we love the game I would not purchase another item from them if they do not back their products.


Thanks for reading and apologies for the long post. Really hope I'm just a one off. 

Also wanted to thank the community here for for all the fantastic posts and comments. You guys are the best, I love coming to this subreddit daily to read your thoughts, rankings, and opinions. Thank you! Without you I wouldn't have found some of my favorite games (or know that counterfeit board games exist. I no longer purchase from Amazon third parties)


TLDR: Received defective Clank! board, Renegade Game Studios customer support said they were sending me a replacement which I never received nor did they respond to my follow-up. Interested in expansions, however would like to hear from the community who dealt with their customer support how it went and if I just fell through the cracks before supporting them further.

All responded quickly and sent replacement components in a timely manner. Their process was quick and simple with no hassles. Some I just explained the issue, others wanted pictures or a more detailed description. Best customer service I&amp;#39;ve received in a while and from different publishers. I couldn&amp;#39;t believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Except for Renegade Game Studios. They agreed to send the board and had all my info so I sat waiting patiently. After not receiving the replacement I followed up requesting an update or tracking number. This email has gone unanswered and I feel I will not receive a replacement and am being ignored. That said, it&amp;#39;s possible my ticket was accidentally closed before shipping and my follow-up email was caught in a spam filter. They might have great customer support and I just fell through the cracks. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the wait we played Clank and loved it. Board wasn&amp;#39;t in the best state but functional. I was highly considering the expansions, and In! Space! for something a little different, but before I dive in I would love to know your experience with the company. As much as we love the game I would not purchase another item from them if they do not back their products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and apologies for the long post. Really hope I&amp;#39;m just a one off. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also wanted to thank the community here for for all the fantastic posts and comments. You guys are the best, I love coming to this subreddit daily to read your thoughts, rankings, and opinions. Thank you! Without you I wouldn&amp;#39;t have found some of my favorite games (or know that counterfeit board games exist. I no longer purchase from Amazon third parties)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR: Received defective Clank! board, Renegade Game Studios customer support said they were sending me a replacement which I never received nor did they respond to my follow-up. Interested in expansions, however would like to hear from the community who dealt with their customer support how it went and if I just fell through the cracks before supporting them further.&lt;/p&gt;

My girlfriend and I recently (about a month ago) started creating content for youtube. We'd sure appreciate you all checking it out!

I'm also excited to get chatting about games with you all!

Most recently we reviewed a new game called ""The Mind"" which has been a  ton of fun!

It's super simple, just trying to place numbered cards in numerical order, but the catch is that you cannot communicate whatsoever!

At first what seems like an unassuming game really comes in to it's own after a round or two, as you come to grips with the usage of ""throwing knives"" and the nature of timing.

We literally can't get enough of this game. So simple yet so fun!

For the record I usually DO NOT agree with Dice Tower assessments, so I was expecting to side with the more dissenting opinions. However……. I really liked it!

It’s a fantastic light area control game with a fun theme. I love area control games and I find they’re generally missing a bit of elegance for me to get them out regularly. This one was fun and simple and had enough variability to keep playing. I like the fixed 9 actions, I like the quality of the components with the strong vibrant colors. The game has depth when planning out your actions, but it’s simple enough even the most casual player can have fun. The most casual in our group had a huge smile on her face as she said “Oh I really like this!”.

I can see where people hate this game, but honestly if you want pure uncompromising determinism where you can play a game way more than other people and always win because of it just go play Chess. There are times where you’ll think “ok I’m going to try this!” and some card will kill your dudes or blow your ship or whatever. If you can’t handle that, then fine. Though it is a game of perfect information when it comes to taking actions. If you have a ship with 4/5 spots filled with your guys, and you’re thinking of making that amazing play where you play the pilot card to change the destination of the ship to the best territory (But it’s last in initiative order) you’re an idiot if you think that’s going to work lol. You know if the other players still have their “Destroy a ship” card and you know this is the perfect time to do it. So play a card higher in initiative that 5, launch your ship to the “Less desirable” territory, and leave your opponents with a tough decision on what ship they have to blow up now. I can see people playing a low initiative card and then getting salty when “shockingly” another player plays a higher initiative card that countered the obvious play they were setting up. We all know those type of gamers……….

All in all the game is great casual fun, and that means it’s worth owning. I will gladly show this to anyone of any gaming skill level and feel confident they will understand it quickly and we can all have a laugh as we launch cute little Astromeeples to Mars and watch them bound about trying to get the best resources. The casual people will feel like they know perfectly well what’s going on, the people who want to think ahead can plan out possibilities with cards that are still in hand, and initiative order and probability (And probably still come out ahead).

BattleCON captures the fast-paced head-to-head intensity of a 2D fighting video game and tempers it with the strategic decision-making of a card game. Imagine Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, Mortal Kombat, or King of Fighters for your kitchen table!  Mechanically, it is a 2-player open-information fighting game focusing on spacing, tactical planning, and reading the opponent.  Every turn, players will make attacks, modify their pairs after they're set, and revealed simultaneously.

The latest expansion (and supposedly final on kickstarter) is being called BattleCON Ultimate and it is a mixture of a new set (Wanderers) and support for existing products.

Key features:

* Rebalance of Devastation of Indines (BattleCON's largest set) to play better with Fate/War/Trials (looking at you, Ottavia/Arec)
* Wanderers of Indines, a set of 10 new characters designed by fans
* Both of above come with tuckboxes and extra bases similar to Trials3
* Updates to Trials/War/Fate
* Art and lore book of Indines
* Storage container

Kickstarter ends in 30 days (10/22)

Just wanted to share some heart-warming board game pride and joy with you all! With the start of a new school year comes our first year anniversary of our school's Board Game Club, and it's been a huge success so far! 

&amp;nbsp;

For a little background, our school specialises in social, emotional and mental health issues for children aged 9-16 - many of whom either live with complex special needs (ASC, ADHD, FASD, bipolar, etc), or are from some pretty damn messy home backgrounds. It all started after I showed some kids in my class Exploding Kittens in an attempt to persuade them away from the PCs during their free time; a game I eventually had to leave in our classroom because of how in demand it was during breaktimes. This very quickly snowballed from me having to bring new games and introduce new classes to them due to popular request, into 20-odd teenagers petitioning our School Council for a dedicated after-school Board Games Club. Guess who the headteacher approached to ask about volunteering to run it? :P

&amp;nbsp;

Now I must be honest, I originally expected it to be a bit of a novelty thing that would gradually dwindle in numbers, but noooope. Since starting it, I've had to increase the number of days it runs, started up a sister ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" club that an autistic 16-year old pupil DMs for us (and very well, I must add!!), and spent way too many hours / personal funds prowling game shops online and offline looking for new things that the kids might be interested in. It's been an absolute pleasure watching these kids refuse time on the Xboxes and Playstations after-school in favour of playing games around the table, alongside other kids irrespective of age, class, special need or ability. I think one of my fondest memories in particular since this club started was watching an incredibly quiet and socially anxious 15-year old girl coach a hyperactive 10-year old boy in Cluedo, which quickly became one of their favourite regular games to play together.

&amp;nbsp;

With the new year starting, I'm looking to bump up our collection of games a little bit - particularly focusing on *variety* to appeal to our 9-16 aged boys and girls of *seriously* varying interests and abilities. I'm a pretty geeky teaching assistant with a fondness for video, board and card games of all types and genres, so I've been able to sustain the club mostly with my own personal games collection (with a few classics here and there provided by the school), but **I'd be more than grateful for some sound second opinions about new recommendations from your wonderful selves!**

&amp;nbsp;

For reference, these are the games (that I remember off the top of my head) that we currently rotate in our collection, with those emboldened probably being our most popular.

&amp;nbsp;

* **The Resistance**
* **Dungeons &amp; Dragons**
* **Exploding Kittens**
* **Bears versus Babies**
* **Dobble**
* **Uno**
* **Jenga**
* **King of Tokyo**
* **Munchkin**
* **Pitchcar Mini**
* **Go Go Gelato!**
* **TIME Stories**
* **The UNLOCK! Series**
* Cluedo
* Chess
* Standard Playing Card games - Rummy, Cheat, Go Fish, etc.
* Carcassonne
* Forbidden Island
* Pandemic
* Labyrinth
* Codenames
* Deception: Murder in Hong Kong
* Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective (although I do have to try and make it a little easier for our lot, haha).
* Love Letter
* Payday

&amp;nbsp;

Easy to set up, simple to teach, short round games are definitely the most ideal for us! The club lasts just under 2 hours, but that includes set-up and pack-down time, and let's say a good chunk of our kids ... well, aren't exactly blessed with the largest of attention spans either, haha. They can also get a little over-competitive and giddy sometimes, which is super cute in terms of their enthusiasm and excitement, but can sometimes result in damaged pieces and cards (even sleeved), so my wallet would definitely prefer games on the lower end of the price scale! :P

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;! Just wanted to share some heart-warming board game pride and joy with you all! With the start of a new school year comes our first year anniversary of our school&amp;#39;s Board Game Club, and it&amp;#39;s been a huge success so far! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a little background, our school specialises in social, emotional and mental health issues for children aged 9-16 - many of whom either live with complex special needs (ASC, ADHD, FASD, bipolar, etc), or are from some pretty damn messy home backgrounds. It all started after I showed some kids in my class Exploding Kittens in an attempt to persuade them away from the PCs during their free time; a game I eventually had to leave in our classroom because of how in demand it was during breaktimes. This very quickly snowballed from me having to bring new games and introduce new classes to them due to popular request, into 20-odd teenagers petitioning our School Council for a dedicated after-school Board Games Club.

Now I just moved to Berlin so it was finally time to get a Kallax to make my humble collection more presentable. For game nights I tend to enjoy heavier games (and with time going by, more Euros), but with bigger groups of friends we sometimes also play party games.

My current favorites are:

\- Twilight Imperium 4 Ed.  
\- Twilight Struggle  
\- Hansa Teutonica  
\- Klask

If you're a Berliner and would like to get together for some games, hit me up! A couple of my friends love to play as well, but since I just got here, I haven't yet started a regular group.

Ordered/Kickstarted but not yet arrived (mostly due to waiting for the German version):

\- Gloomhaven  
\- Spirit Island  
\- 7th Continent  
\- Escape Plan  
\- Lisboa  
\- Pax Pamir 2nd Ed.

Games I'm planning on getting are, in descending order or relevance:

\- A Feast for Odin  
\- Gaia Project  
\- Yellow and Yangtze  
\- Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective  
\- Fenris for Scythe (I don't like Scythe that much, but hope that this expansion will be worth it. What do you think?)  
\- Letters from Whitechapel

Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. I sold all games that I don't enjoy to play (besides Scythe b/c of Fenris and Colt Express as my gateway game into this world due to nostalgia), so I'm down for anything to play in the picture.  


I'd love to hear your thoughts, criticism and/or recommendations!

It's a nice visual to see all the games and links to videos the creator made. You can also click into the game to see all the videos for that associated game. I'll be adding more features to associate more videos with each game in the future. I'm even hoping to have a filter in the advanced search for search by channel name.

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of **[Gamelyn Games](https://www.gamelyngames.com/)**, best known for the Tiny Epic series, and who have a Kickstarter running RIGHT NOW for **[Tiny Epic Mechs](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coe/tiny-epic-mechs-mechanized-entertainment-combat-he)**. 

Gamelyn has generously donated the following prizes:

* 2 copies of **[Tiny Epic Zombies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244536/tiny-epic-zombies)** and a playmat for each, fresh off its recent Kickstarter delivery. 
* A copy of **[Tiny Epic Galaxies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163967/tiny-epic-galaxies)**, along with the **Beyond the Black** expansion, playmats for each, and a Gamelyn plushie! 

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What's the oldest game in your collection or group that still sees regular play?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship WORLDWIDE. Thanks again to Gamelyn for their generosity. 

##The fine print

These giveaways are open until 5:30 a.m. Pacific time the day after they are posted. Comments made after 5:30 a.m. will not be eligible to win. Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Anyone caught attempting to game the system by leaving multiple comments in a single post will be disqualified from this and all subsequent giveaways. If you’re eligible for two giveaways in a single day, you may enter both, though we ask you to consider your level of interest in the specific prizes before doing so, out of consideration for those who may be eligible for only one giveaway.

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

And now, here are the winners, along with their answers to the giveaway question:

* /u/Ace_Wolfe wins a copy of **Twilight Struggle** from GMT Games, along with a collector’s-edition copy of the latest issue of C3i Magazine.

&gt; Like many others, space is one of my favorites. Cosmic Encounters, Galaxy Trucker, Race for the Galaxy, heck I even like the XCom board game.

* /u/FailingHappenstance wins a copy of **Dominant Species** from GMT Games, along with a collector’s-edition copy of the latest issue of C3i Magazine.

&gt; I think space or industry. Space in terms of space ships, mars, anything to deal with it. Industry kinda coincides with Space a lot (terraforming mars), but I also enjoy just down to earth industry games like Brass and Power Grid.

* /u/timbone316 wins a copy of **Nyctophobia**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; Definitely retro sci fi. Unfortunately, not many games at all cater to it (Rayguns and Rocketships comes to mind), but that is a theme I love. Why aren't there more board games with that aesthetic?

* /u/DarthOtter wins a copy of **Nyctophobia**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I do love the sci fi theme, but my favourites are mash ups or weird variations on the science fiction theme.

* /u/Doc_Faust wins a copy of **Nyctophobia**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I quite like the theme of Tokaido, mostly because of the way it manifests. ""Try to have a great vacation, and make sure all your friends have the worst vacation possible.""

* /u/cptstnkpnts wins a copy of **Dinosaur Island**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; Anything but Cthulu. It's been done to death in the board gaming world.

* /u/Syhra wins a copy of **Dinosaur Island**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I love exploration! That feeling of discovery and adventure. I particularly enjoy games with modular/randomized setup.

&gt; Some exploration-ish games I play are 7th Continent, Escape:Curse of the Temple, and Forbidden Desert.

* /u/dyzzy wins a copy of **Dinosaur Island**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I know it's cliche, but I love Lovecraft. I've played far too many bad games with Cthulhu stapled onto them.

I'll be reaching out to the winners via PM. Thanks to the more than 2,000 of you who participated, and keep an eye out for more giveaways in the days ahead!

&lt;p&gt;And now, here are the winners, along with their answers to the giveaway question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/Ace_Wolfe""&gt;/u/Ace_Wolfe&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Twilight Struggle&lt;/strong&gt; from GMT Games, along with a collector’s-edition copy of the latest issue of C3i Magazine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like many others, space is one of my favorites. Cosmic Encounters, Galaxy Trucker, Race for the Galaxy, heck I even like the XCom board game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/FailingHappenstance""&gt;/u/FailingHappenstance&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Dominant Species&lt;/strong&gt; from GMT Games, along with a collector’s-edition copy of the latest issue of C3i Magazine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think space or industry. Space in terms of space ships, mars, anything to deal with it. Industry kinda coincides with Space a lot (terraforming mars), but I also enjoy just down to earth industry games like Brass and Power Grid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/timbone316""&gt;/u/timbone316&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Nyctophobia&lt;/strong&gt;, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definitely retro sci fi. Unfortunately, not many games at all cater to it (Rayguns and Rocketships comes to mind), but that is a theme I love. Why aren&amp;#39;t there more board games with that aesthetic?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/DarthOtter""&gt;/u/DarthOtter&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Nyctophobia&lt;/strong&gt;, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I do love the sci fi theme, but my favourites are mash ups or weird variations on the science fiction theme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/Doc_Faust""&gt;/u/Doc_Faust&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Nyctophobia&lt;/strong&gt;, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I quite like the theme of Tokaido, mostly because of the way it manifests. &amp;quot;Try to have a great vacation, and make sure all your friends have the worst vacation possible.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/cptstnkpnts""&gt;/u/cptstnkpnts&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Dinosaur Island&lt;/strong&gt;, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anything but Cthulu. It&amp;#39;s been done to death in the board gaming world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/Syhra""&gt;/u/Syhra&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Dinosaur Island&lt;/strong&gt;, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love exploration! That feeling of discovery and adventure. I particularly enjoy games with modular/randomized setup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some exploration-ish games I play are 7th Continent, Escape:Curse of the Temple, and Forbidden Desert.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/dyzzy""&gt;/u/dyzzy&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Dinosaur Island&lt;/strong&gt;, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know it&amp;#39;s cliche, but I love Lovecraft. I&amp;#39;ve played far too many bad games with Cthulhu stapled onto them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be reaching out to the winners via PM. Thanks to the more than 2,000 of you who participated, and keep an eye out for more giveaways in the days ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure.  In each of the five rounds, you secretly choose if you want to continue exploring the temple in search of more treasure or retreat to the safety of your camp with your share of the treasure that has been discovered so far.

Each time that an explorer braves new territory, more treasure or a danger appears.  When a second card of the same type of danger is turned over, all exposed treasure is buried, leaving the remaining adventurers with nothing.  Do you flee the dangerous temple with your portion of the treasure that has been uncovered so far or do you venture into the exciting temple in search of more hidden valuables?

After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and winner!

From the publisher:  ""You and your fellow adventurers travel to Peru to find a ruined Incan temple and its treasures:  turquoise, obsidian, and gold.  There are also rumors of valuable Incan artifacts.  Will you chance dangers like giant spiders, mummies, and fire during your search, or will you escape back to camp and safety, carrying out your loot?""

Re-implemented by:

    Risco Total (Released as an unauthorized game. An agreement has since been made between the authors and the publisher.)

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Description from Boardgamegeek&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure.  In each of the five rounds, you secretly choose if you want to continue exploring the temple in search of more treasure or retreat to the safety of your camp with your share of the treasure that has been discovered so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each time that an explorer braves new territory, more treasure or a danger appears.  When a second card of the same type of danger is turned over, all exposed treasure is buried, leaving the remaining adventurers with nothing.  Do you flee the dangerous temple with your portion of the treasure that has been uncovered so far or do you venture into the exciting temple in search of more hidden valuables?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and winner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the publisher:  &amp;quot;You and your fellow adventurers travel to Peru to find a ruined Incan temple and its treasures:  turquoise, obsidian, and gold.  There are also rumors of valuable Incan artifacts.  Will you chance dangers like giant spiders, mummies, and fire during your search, or will you escape back to camp and safety, carrying out your loot?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

That random thought soon became an obsession as I started designing the game in my head every free moment I got. It didn’t take long to put pen to paper and I soon started creating crude cards (hand drawn on cut up craft paper). 
The very first prototype and the very first idea frankly were embarrassingly bad. I knew I wanted to make a game about the fickle nature of Gods, and the tension between them, but the execution of it was far far away from my goal. At this point, I knew nothing about board game design, knew nothing about what it took to launch a game, or any such thing for that matter. All I had was a crudely thrown together game and a bunch of really great friends who were willing to give me hours and hours of their time to help me perfect it. 
Around this time, as I continued testing with friends, I started reading Jamie Steigmaier’s blog, and I also decided to start my social media presence. 

**Sidenote 1:** The board game industry is extremely unique in how open the people are that “make it”. Few industries in the world foster the startups in their space as openly, and honestly, as in this business.

**Sidenote to fellow aspiring developers:** You can never start reading this early enough if you want to venture into this space. And the amazing people that will answer your questions, take the time to read your rulebook, take the time to comment on your artwork etc. is an asset that you should truly utilize. In retrospect, I only wish I had done more of it, instead of shying away because putting yourself out there is difficult.

I initially started by writing a blog and writing about board games in general. I had the idea to showcase people from different parts of the board gaming community (like reviewers, game developers, board game cafes etc.), I called them MyJourneyWednesdays and it was my attempt to try to do something unique to stand out. Along with it, I created a very crudely drawn comic series to “introduce” my game.

**Sidenote 2:** There are a lot, a lot, of game developers, reviewers, podcasters, you name it. Something else truly unique about this industry is how many people feel empowered to create, critique, analyze, and evangelize. And everyone is so welcoming and happy to share their stories. Out of all the things I did, this was one of the more rewarding experiences. I got to know some amazing people because of this.

**Sidenote to fellow aspiring developers:** People follow you if you have something interesting to say. I learned this through trial and error, but what I didn’t learn early enough is that what you have to say should be fairly consistent with what you want to do. Consistency of message, especially leading up to a launch cannot be understated.

I soon got to a point where I thought I was ready to start creating illustrations for the game, based purely on play testing with friends. I made several critical errors here. One, I started with an artist way too early in the process, two, I didn’t understand the value of a graphical designer even after reading about the need for one on multiple blogs, but three, most importantly, I underestimated the value of blind playtesting.
I charged full steam ahead, spending a couple of thousand dollars creating artwork, and building copies through gamecrafter. The game at that point required simply drawing cards from a central pile, lasted forever, and was 70% luck, 30% strategy.

**Sidenote 3**: Gamecrafter rocks :) I cannot even imagine how difficult it must have been to create prototypes before they, or companies like them, existed.

**Sidenote to fellow aspiring developers:** Literally do not do any of the things I did up there.

Through one of the people I interviewed, I came to know of this group called Unpub that helps indie developers like me by connecting us to play testers. I cannot tell you how huge this was for me. Until then, I had little to no play testing outside of my friends. And the very first game I played with these guys was a splash of cold water. By only playing with friends, I had come to believe I had a great game in my hand. The reality of it was, the game was far from ready. But I didn’t want to just take the word of these guys just yet, and I sent the game out to a group called the Indie Game Alliance which connects blind play testers and developers like me. I further, foolishly, sent the game to a couple of reviewers when I was far from ready. The feedback that came back was a much-needed reality check. 
I was at a cross roads at that point. Make minor fixes and try to launch a mediocre game, or call a timeout to myself. I decided to do the latter. I was extremely demotivated at this point (I was already a year into this journey) and I almost stopped working on the game.

**Sidenote 4:** Shoutout to all the people that devote hours to play testing half-finished games. Our community will never see half the games in the market if not for you guys.

**Sidenote to fellow aspiring developers:** Few friends will give brutally honest feedback because they will always prioritize protecting your feelings. They can help weed out the truly terrible ideas, but go out and play test with strangers if you want true feedback. Unpub is the best, and definitely something to be a part of for an aspiring designer.

However, I decided to keep going, and rather than try to course correct myself back on to the right path, I decided to start with a blank piece of paper. Again, one of the best decisions I could have made. I was back to cutting up sheets of blank paper, but I knew the game was coming together in a way that truly excited me. I incorporated elements like deck building, a modular map, and variable player powers in a way that fit the theme really well, and made the game feel a lot more cohesive. I completely reversed the ratio of luck to strategy, with the game now having 80-90% strategy and 10-20% luck.
And this time, I did it the right way, play testing early in the process by going to local events and going to an Unpub event in Maryland.

**Sidenote 5:** The Gameskeep (near Philly) was kind enough to allow me to play test at their store during open game nights. Another nice aspect of the community is how unthreatened people are by seeming competition (can you imagine spending 3 hours at a restaurant bringing food from home and not spending on anything else? Of course, I ended up buying a couple of games on my trips, but not because I was expected to ;)).

The Unpub event was a huge morale boost. Everyone who played the game loved it, and 2 groups of people came back to play it again within a few hours because they enjoyed it so much. Now, properly armed with feedback, I restarted the process of designing the game, with new artwork, and with a graphical designer, as well as restarting my social media reach out.
I soon got prototypes and sent it out to reviewers. All along the way, complete strangers would offer help and provide feedback (such as reviewing the rulebook, answering questions on manufacturing costs etc.). The one thing I should have done more of, is going for the “close”. I assumed that getting people to follow you on social media is sufficient. It is not. Getting their contact information is quite necessary.

**Sidenote to aspiring developers:** The board game industry is friendly, but hyper competitive (fittingly). It is not enough to have a great game, you need to capture people’s imagination and hold their attention. If it is not you, there are a hundred others in line to do so.

I just launched my game (Deities Domination) to Kickstarter a couple of days ago, to stiff competition, and while it has been off to a slow start, I have had the most amazing outpouring of support from various corners of the board gaming world to keep me motivated and pushing to succeed.
I learned a ton these last two years. Whether I fail or succeed the first time, I know what mistakes to avoid, and what is absolutely critical. 

Finally, never change you guys :)

I charged full steam ahead, spending a couple of thousand dollars creating artwork, and building copies through gamecrafter. The game at that point required simply drawing cards from a central pile, lasted forever, and was 70% luck, 30% strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Gamecrafter rocks :) I cannot even imagine how difficult it must have been to create prototypes before they, or companies like them, existed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote to fellow aspiring developers:&lt;/strong&gt; Literally do not do any of the things I did up there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through one of the people I interviewed, I came to know of this group called Unpub that helps indie developers like me by connecting us to play testers. I cannot tell you how huge this was for me. Until then, I had little to no play testing outside of my friends. And the very first game I played with these guys was a splash of cold water. By only playing with friends, I had come to believe I had a great game in my hand. The reality of it was, the game was far from ready. But I didn’t want to just take the word of these guys just yet, and I sent the game out to a group called the Indie Game Alliance which connects blind play testers and developers like me. I further, foolishly, sent the game to a couple of reviewers when I was far from ready. The feedback that came back was a much-needed reality check. 
I was at a cross roads at that point. Make minor fixes and try to launch a mediocre game, or call a timeout to myself. I decided to do the latter. I was extremely demotivated at this point (I was already a year into this journey) and I almost stopped working on the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote 4:&lt;/strong&gt; Shoutout to all the people that devote hours to play testing half-finished games. Our community will never see half the games in the market if not for you guys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote to fellow aspiring developers:&lt;/strong&gt; Few friends will give brutally honest feedback because they will always prioritize protecting your feelings. They can help weed out the truly terrible ideas, but go out and play test with strangers if you want true feedback. Unpub is the best, and definitely something to be a part of for an aspiring designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, I decided to keep going, and rather than try to course correct myself back on to the right path, I decided to start with a blank piece of paper. Again, one of the best decisions I could have made. I was back to cutting up sheets of blank paper, but I knew the game was coming together in a way that truly excited me. I incorporated elements like deck building, a modular map, and variable player powers in a way that fit the theme really well, and made the game feel a lot more cohesive. I completely reversed the ratio of luck to strategy, with the game now having 80-90% strategy and 10-20% luck.
And this time, I did it the right way, play testing early in the process by going to local events and going to an Unpub event in Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote 5:&lt;/strong&gt; The Gameskeep (near Philly) was kind enough to allow me to play test at their store during open game nights. Another nice aspect of the community is how unthreatened people are by seeming competition (can you imagine spending 3 hours at a restaurant bringing food from home and not spending on anything else? Of course, I ended up buying a couple of games on my trips, but not because I was expected to ;)).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Unpub event was a huge morale boost. Everyone who played the game loved it, and 2 groups of people came back to play it again within a few hours because they enjoyed it so much. Now, properly armed with feedback, I restarted the process of designing the game, with new artwork, and with a graphical designer, as well as restarting my social media reach out.
I soon got prototypes and sent it out to reviewers. All along the way, complete strangers would offer help and provide feedback (such as reviewing the rulebook, answering questions on manufacturing costs etc.). The one thing I should have done more of, is going for the “close”. I assumed that getting people to follow you on social media is sufficient. It is not. Getting their contact information is quite necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sidenote to aspiring developers:&lt;/strong&gt; The board game industry is friendly, but hyper competitive (fittingly). It is not enough to have a great game, you need to capture people’s imagination and hold their attention. If it is not you, there are a hundred others in line to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just launched my game (Deities Domination) to Kickstarter a couple of days ago, to stiff competition, and while it has been off to a slow start, I have had the most amazing outpouring of support from various corners of the board gaming world to keep me motivated and pushing to succeed.
I learned a ton these last two years. Whether I fail or succeed the first time, I know what mistakes to avoid, and what is absolutely critical. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, never change you guys :)&lt;/p&gt;

My idea is basically to create over 30 new furnishings and at the start of every game you put out special furnishings equal to 1 plus the amount of players. 

To make sure these furnishings have an impact every game, I made them more OP than the base dwellings. However, to balance this out, each player can only buy 1 special furnishing.

I would love to hear your thoughts on the balance of the furnishings. I want them all to be slightly OP. If you think any are too weak/too strong please let me know! Also feel free to suggest better names (mine are terrible haha) and adjustments to the abilities.

**Loot room / lvl 5+ weapon / 3 vp:** During expeditions, you can take the same loot item up to 3 times (instead of 1 time).

**Bladesmith / 2 stone, 1 ruby / 3 vp:** immediately +10 ore. When you forge a weapon, you can spend 1-14 ore (instead of 1-8 ore) and the created weapon level is 1-14.

So I bring some games over, we play some video games, and then it's just a ""wanna play this new game?"" and we just transition over to whatever board game. It's all super relaxed.

When we can, though, we try to organize game nights and get more people over. Since I'm the one with the games, I feel like it's on me to decide a lot of this. I generally plan for a variety of different player counts, depending on who shows up. So I have a collection of games to play for 4, 5, or 6 players.

We've been getting into heavier games recently, though, and I'm realizing that teaching Blood Rage and Scythe to a couple of people that have never played either of them could be... really rough. Both in terms of explaining, and that's just a lot to learn all in one night.

On top of that, there's the issue of time. I always bring more games than we have time to play, it seems, just from people showing up later than expected or rules taking longer to teach, etc. And it's still definitely fun, but I'm always a little disappointed that we didn't get to play one game or another.

So to the people that organize more consistent game nights- How do you go about selecting games and managing time? How do you teach new games efficiently?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group of people I generally play with is the same group of people I&amp;#39;m hanging out with every couple of nights. So I bring some games over, we play some video games, and then it&amp;#39;s just a &amp;quot;wanna play this new game?&amp;quot; and we just transition over to whatever board game. It&amp;#39;s all super relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we can, though, we try to organize game nights and get more people over. Since I&amp;#39;m the one with the games, I feel like it&amp;#39;s on me to decide a lot of this. I generally plan for a variety of different player counts, depending on who shows up. So I have a collection of games to play for 4, 5, or 6 players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;ve been getting into heavier games recently, though, and I&amp;#39;m realizing that teaching Blood Rage and Scythe to a couple of people that have never played either of them could be... really rough. Both in terms of explaining, and that&amp;#39;s just a lot to learn all in one night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that, there&amp;#39;s the issue of time. I always bring more games than we have time to play, it seems, just from people showing up later than expected or rules taking longer to teach, etc. And it&amp;#39;s still definitely fun, but I&amp;#39;m always a little disappointed that we didn&amp;#39;t get to play one game or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to the people that organize more consistent game nights- How do you go about selecting games and managing time? How do you teach new games efficiently?&lt;/p&gt;

When it happens, I have identified 4 unique personas and how they act. 

&amp;#x200B;

* Pacifist - Try not to affect the outcome of the game and bow out with grace. This player will not interfere with the rival players who are contesting the win because he has no vested interest in the outcome.
* Spike - Named after the Magic the Gathering persona. Spike wants to win at all costs, if winning isn't possible spike will still play the best game he can to maximize his score or position.
* Vorthos - Named for the Magic the Gathering persona who cares about theme and flavor. This player will act in a way that thematically makes sense to his faction, race or character. This can play out in a variety of ways. Perhaps he will attempt to get revenge from a player who wrong him earlier? Perhaps he will help the science faction win over the warmongering faction because ""his faction"" would rather be governed by the scientists.
* Harmony - This player aims to bring balance to the remaining players by hurting the winning player or helping the most losing player. They will attempt to make the closest game possible.

&lt;li&gt;Spike - Named after the Magic the Gathering persona. Spike wants to win at all costs, if winning isn&amp;#39;t possible spike will still play the best game he can to maximize his score or position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vorthos - Named for the Magic the Gathering persona who cares about theme and flavor. This player will act in a way that thematically makes sense to his faction, race or character. This can play out in a variety of ways. Perhaps he will attempt to get revenge from a player who wrong him earlier? Perhaps he will help the science faction win over the warmongering faction because &amp;quot;his faction&amp;quot; would rather be governed by the scientists.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Harmony - This player aims to bring balance to the remaining players by hurting the winning player or helping the most losing player. They will attempt to make the closest game possible.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

**Description**: There's no rhyme or reason for why I buy specific games. Whatever looks fun - even if I don't think I'll have the player count for it. It's a disease really.

There are a few smaller games (like Coup and Schotten Totten) not shown as they're sitting in that basket toward the bottom right, and that game under Forbidden Desert is Stratego. Love the game, love the box, but a pain to store. Oh, and that tackle box is filled with Star Wars Destiny dice.


Before the second kallax the top of the first was sort of overflowing and made things a pain to pull off the shelf. Much more manageable now!


Not pictued: My X-Wing collection as it's still packed away.

**How long have you been involved in the hobby?:** Probably 4 years now? Give or take a year.

**What would you change about your collection if you could?:** The amount of shrink wrap I still have hanging around... I don't play nearly enough to justify the amount of games I buy.

**What is your favorite game you own:** Even after all these years, it's probably *King of Tokyo*. It's the easiest to bring to the table no matter the players' experience level.

**What are your newest games?:** The X-Wing 2.0 stuff if that counts. Say Anything otherwise.

**What games might be leaving your collection soon?:** I've actually been wondering about this recently. Myth is probably the number one game I'd be willing to give up. It just... wasn't my favorite.

Featured game: **Sekigahara: The Unification of Japan**

The battle of Sekigahara, fought in 1600 at a crossroads in Japan, unified that nation under the Tokugawa family for more than 250 years.

Sekigahara allows you to re-contest that war as Ishida Mitsunari, defender of a child heir, or Tokugawa Ieyasu, Japan's most powerful daimyo (feudal lord).

The campaign lasted only 7 weeks, during which each side improvised an army and a strategy with what forces their allies could provide. Each leader harbored deep doubts as to the loyalty of his units - for good reason. Several daimyo refused to fight; some even turned sides in the midst of battle.

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of **[Pandasaurus Games](https://www.pandasaurusgames.com/)**, which has been on a roll lately with several major releases, including **Dinosaur Island**, **Nyctophobia**, and the U.S. release of **The Mind**. 

Pandad has been exceptionally generous and offered up the following prizes:

* 3 copies of **[Dinosaur Island](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/221194/dinosaur-island)**
* 3 copies of **[Nyctophobia](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/249505/nyctophobia)**

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What’s your favorite theme? It can be a theme from a single game, or a theme that appeals to you and will make you consider any game with that theme.**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship to NORTH AMERICA ONLY. 

##The fine print

Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

&lt;p&gt;To enter, all you have to do is &lt;em&gt;leave a top-level comment&lt;/em&gt; answering the following question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s your favorite theme? It can be a theme from a single game, or a theme that appeals to you and will make you consider any game with that theme.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, &lt;em&gt;please do not enter&lt;/em&gt;. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, &lt;em&gt;please do not enter&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too &lt;a href=""/r/hailcorporate""&gt;/r/hailcorporate&lt;/a&gt;,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of [GMT Games](https://www.gmtgames.com/)**, the longtime masters of all things wargaming and a giant in the board game industry. GMT has generously donated the following prizes:

* A copy of the latest printing of [Dominant Species](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/62219/dominant-species), fresh off its recent P500 run
* A copy of [Twilight Struggle](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12333/twilight-struggle), the 2-player game of Cold War intrigue and former No.1 game on BGG. 

**Additionally**, each winner will receive a collector’s edition copy of the latest issue of [C3i Magazine](https://www.c3iopscenter.com), which has covered war games for more than two decades. The [latest issue](https://www.c3iopscenter.com/pages/wargame-room-store/#!/C3i-Magazine-Nr-31/p/113575090/category=30676727) includes the standalone wargame “The Battle of Wakefield.”

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What’s your favorite theme? It can be a theme from a single game, or a theme that appeals to you and will make you consider any game with that theme.**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship to the US ONLY. This one will be run similarly to the previous giveaway for **Root**; GMT shipped the games to me, and I will ship to the winners. I will cover some of the cost out of my own pocket, but the *winners will be required to transfer $10 via PayPal* to cover the remainder. If you are unable or unwilling to do this, *please do not enter*. The copies of C3i magazine will be shipped separately.

##The fine print

Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

And now, here are the winners of the 10 copies of Sprawlopolis from Button Shy, with their answers to the giveaway question:

* /u/dettonator11

&gt; One summer I posted on Facebook looking for a game group that met consistently. Turns out there was one. I've been going ever since.

* /u/nlshelton

&gt; I have two different game groups currently that are mostly separate, but with some bleedover occasionally during local conventions and such. But both groups I met through Meetup - one was specifically board-game-focused, and the other was a bit more general geekdom and we all just happened to really like board games.

&gt; Meetup. Can't recommend it enough!

* /u/superharrybob

&gt; There was a great board game club at my college that introduced me to modern board games. The people there were fantastic friendly people and had open board gaming every Friday night. I made some great friends there. I kept in touch with a couple of them and I've been playing games with them and a few other friends that we convinced to play with us for six years now. We don't play a lot since it's getting harder for us all to meet up so I'm trying to get to the local game store that has a group. I'll get there one day... maybe...

* /u/spork3

&gt; Grad school. It's the perfect activity for an inexpensive, mentally stimulating social gathering. And in the years we've played together we've never had a problem with ""that guy"". They're all great, honest gamers.

* /u/vengefulsnap 

&gt; I found my game group through improv. I live in NYC, and have been improvising for years. One of my teammates invited me to join his existing group for a campaign of Dungeon World. We’ve since transitioned to board games.

* /u/Lechonbaka

&gt; My gaming group was established before I got there... but I found them through a college friend's high school friend's then girlfriend. We all attended the same party and introductions were made and friendships began!

* /u/crackslaw

&gt; I don’t necessarily have a gamer group. My boyfriend and I really bonded over a few games and then got really into board games. We started with games that were good for two players (and still stick to those mostly) but found that there are some games that are impossible/not nearly as good without a larger group. We pull in a handful of friends every now and then but it’s not a solid group all the time. I wish I had more friends into games!!

* /u/zachhorn117

&gt; My normal friend group became my game group once we migrated from video games. Also found more people at work!

* /u/thekoopy

&gt; I found my game group by slowly indoctrinating my friends around me. They've always been open to any new hobby so they took to it pretty quickly. 12 years later we all still play!

* /u/Abakus07

&gt; A friend at university started dating a guy who knew a couple that hosted game nights. I was invited along to make it a bit less like a date I think?

&gt; That was 6 years ago. We've added and lost quite a few people in that time, but me and that guy have hung out almost every week since then to play board games.

**And the winner of a $75 gift card from Miniature Market:**

* /u/Xiyther

&gt; Friends and friends of friends mostly. Plus I found another gaming group that had started doing meetups in a pub.

&gt; Pretty good going to have found so many since the closest FLGS to us is nearly four hours drive away.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be reaching out to the winners via PM. Thanks to the more than 3,000 of you who participated, and keep an eye out for more giveaways in the days ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

I've played the game on four or five different occasions since then and absolutely loved it each time.  
Let's start with the artwork. It's beautiful! Great detail on the figures, the board is well-designed, and the Elder God cards are lovely. Even the artwork contained in the rule book demonstrates an investment in time and the application of creativity and skill.   
 The components (thick cards, dice, Elder sign tokens, and various plastic figures) are sturdy and made to last.   
The rule book is easy to understand. The only issue our play team bumped up against was that per the rule book, the control actions are supposed to be done *after* the basic actions, but in at least one case the instructions contradict themselves and indicate it should be done before the basic actions.  A minor issue all things considered and one it should be easy to get clarification on from the designers through Instagram or BoardGameGeek.com.   
The play moves quickly so the game is not prone to analysis paralysis. It's fun, highly interactive, with just the right amount of ""take that"" built in.   
And the theme - I LOVE the Cthulhu horror theme! As typical for this genre, we have the cultists versus the investigators and in Fate of the Elder Gods we are on the side of the cultists. Too many investigators in your cultist lodge and you get raided and penalized with elder sign seals that represent the success of the investigators in sealing off the eldritch horrors. Pile up too many and you lose the game.   
This game is well balanced both under two player and three player games (we did not have the opportunity to play with four players) and the only potential improvement I can see is the addition of some kind of bonus to the second, third, and fourth players to compensate for turn order. Perhaps an extra turn at the end of the game or an extra cultist placed initially.   
I have 740+ board games in my collection. Because of its strengths and engaging game play, Fate of the Elder Gods is one of the top 20 games I reach for when friends come over to play. I recently picked up the expansion for the base game, Beasts From Beyond, and I am beyond excited to get it to the table as well.

*OUI: I would play this game again; this game is ok. I probably would not buy this game myself but I would play it with those who own it and if someone gave it to me I would keep it.*

*OUI OUI: I would play this game again; this game is good. I would buy this game.*

*OUI OUI OUI: I LOVE THIS GAME. I MUST HAVE THIS GAME.*  

*NON: I would not play this game again. I would return this game or give it away if it was given to me.*  
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I picked up Fate of the Elder Gods from the friendly staff at Greater Than Games during a gaming convention visit. I&amp;#39;ve played the game on four or five different occasions since then and absolutely loved it each time.&lt;br/&gt;
Let&amp;#39;s start with the artwork. It&amp;#39;s beautiful! Great detail on the figures, the board is well-designed, and the Elder God cards are lovely. Even the artwork contained in the rule book demonstrates an investment in time and the application of creativity and skill. &lt;br/&gt;
 The components (thick cards, dice, Elder sign tokens, and various plastic figures) are sturdy and made to last. &lt;br/&gt;
The rule book is easy to understand. The only issue our play team bumped up against was that per the rule book, the control actions are supposed to be done &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; the basic actions, but in at least one case the instructions contradict themselves and indicate it should be done before the basic actions.  A minor issue all things considered and one it should be easy to get clarification on from the designers through Instagram or BoardGameGeek.com. &lt;br/&gt;
The play moves quickly so the game is not prone to analysis paralysis. It&amp;#39;s fun, highly interactive, with just the right amount of &amp;quot;take that&amp;quot; built in. &lt;br/&gt;
And the theme - I LOVE the Cthulhu horror theme! As typical for this genre, we have the cultists versus the investigators and in Fate of the Elder Gods we are on the side of the cultists. Too many investigators in your cultist lodge and you get raided and penalized with elder sign seals that represent the success of the investigators in sealing off the eldritch horrors. Pile up too many and you lose the game. &lt;br/&gt;
This game is well balanced both under two player and three player games (we did not have the opportunity to play with four players) and the only potential improvement I can see is the addition of some kind of bonus to the second, third, and fourth players to compensate for turn order. Perhaps an extra turn at the end of the game or an extra cultist placed initially. &lt;br/&gt;
I have 740+ board games in my collection. Because of its strengths and engaging game play, Fate of the Elder Gods is one of the top 20 games I reach for when friends come over to play. I recently picked up the expansion for the base game, Beasts From Beyond, and I am beyond excited to get it to the table as well.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go get this game. Go get it now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Publisher: Greater Than Games&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Players: 1-4 (We played with 2 and 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actual Playing Time (vs the guideline on the box): About 90 minutes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game type: area control, dice rolling, worker placement&lt;/p&gt;

Hi there, everyone!


My name is Will, and my partner Chalene and I have spent the last month and a half going from FLGS to board game cafe to board game meetups all around Europe (and a little bit of Canada!) recording episodes of our personalized boardgame reccomendation podcast: *People Seek Meeple: The Board Game Problem Solvers*!


We've just made our fifth episode and I am super proud to share it with the community that made a lot of this possible. For the last while, I've been quietly approaching people on the Daily Discussion thread and asking them if it was okay to answer their question on our podcast, and it's been a lot of fun.


Prior to making this podcast, Chalene and I spent a  year working at a board game restaurant in Vancouver as Game Stewards, suggesting and teaching board games to confused/overwhelmed/curious customers, and now that we're abroad, spending a year in Europe we decided that we wouldn't let a bit of travel get in the way of a job we loved. Our technology is pretty rudimentary. We have a Snowball Mic and a tablet, which all our editing is done on, so it's certainly not professional grade, but we aren't really aiming to be up there in the boardgaming Podcaster hall of fame. We just want to share our passion, be creative, and most importantly, help fellow board game enthusiasts!


If you'd like to give us a listen, you can [right here.](https://anchor.fm/peopleseekmeeple) (you can also find us where all the other podcast things happen, I think?) but even better, if you have a question for us that you think would make for an interesting segment *please* don't hesitate to send a question on our sub: r/peopleseekmeeple 


Once again, thanks so much to this community for making our podcasty dream a reality! If you have any other kinds of questions, be sure to leave a comment. I'm more than happy to talk about the podcast and receive any pro tips you might have, and constructive criticism is always welcome!


OH! And if you live anywhere in Europe (honestly, pretty much anywhere), we might be in your neck of the woods over the course of the year. If you think you know of a lovely spot to record or know of a good group to play some boardgames with then please let us know. We want to meet as many like-minded individuals as we can and would love to meet some faces behind the usernames.


Thanks for reading this, and thanks again for being you!

Me even more so since i got to paint the wonderful minis.

To the point. 
Now i’m looking to expand my collection and i’ve had my eye on Rising Sun for a while. 
Looks lika a solid game and more minis to paint :D 
So my question is how similar to each other are these games?

I’ve heard they have a similar feel to them and i’m afraid to hear  something like ”This is pretty much Bloodrage but with samurais”

Loved the idea, was completely convinced that I would play season 1 and move on to season 2.  Got a group together to play season 1 and it went really well for a while.

Sometime around June or July it started to drag, and we've only lost a couple of times.  It felt repetitive, didn't feel like much was changing, just the same old objectives with slight variations.  More rules and bookkeeping kept being added to a point where we couldn't remember everything we were supposed to do.  Every role, relationship, extra actions.  I'm sure we probably forgot to do some scars at some point.  It's also starting to feel the luck factor is bumping up, a bad swing of luck with the cards can spell disaster.  We literally had one game that lasted 1 round of four players.  We drew a ton of cards from our ""special"" color from both decks and had outbreaks like crazy that we couldn't contain.  We couldn't even charter flights to get there to do anything about it.

Overall I had fun but I wish it was maybe 1/4th shorter.  That would have helped it not feel as repetitive, the story would have come a lot faster, easier to brush off bad luck as the ending is coming sooner.

*DISCLAIMER: I am a huge fan of asymmetrical wargames (including Chaos in the Old World, Root, COIN games...etc.). This is not meant to criticize the genre as a whole, but to make a point about putting game balance in the hands of the player.*

So what is that point? You should not rely on players to balance the game. Why? For many reasons. 

* Most importantly, people are unpredictable. Just because the game would be balanced *if* they commit themselves to a certain course of action doesn't mean they will do so. Even if it's in their best interests, they might just not do it. If they refuse to do their ""part"" and that ""part"" is important for game balance, then the whole game could be unbalanced.

* ""Ganging up on the Leader"" leads to a fragile game state. If you require your players to beat down the OP faction, it's only going to throw the game to one of the other players (and sometimes, it's the one who took the least amount of time to beat down the leader). If your game over-relies on players ganging up on the leader, the winner will likely not be determined by strategy as much as it is determined by a game of whack-a-mole, and they happened to eke out a victory before it was their turn to be whacked.

* Kingmaking is annoying. And the above point to plays into that. In Root, you get little reward for beating down the Vagabond (unlike when you beat down other factions, inexplicably). So if you take the time to keep the Vagabond down, you're decreasing both your chance of winning and the Vagabond's to the benefit of the other opponents' chances. 

* Newer players are going to throw game balance off each time you play with them. If you depend on players knowing how the game is weighted, then every time you play with someone with less experience, there's a great chance they won't fully understand their ""role"" to play, which can shift the chance of victory to whoever is most advantaged by their inexperience. Players can tell them what they ""should"" be doing, but they will be understandably suspicious of this, thinking the players might be telling them this just to advantage themselves.

So what should designers of these types of games do? Well, I think Root got it mostly right (outside the Vagabond). **Beating someone down should be tangibly beneficial for you beyond just bringing them down,** so that you are incentivized to attack whoever has the best chance at winning. This makes it less arbitrary and more natural. Otherwise you often end up at a crossroads like this:

You're in 3rd place. 1st place is getting close to winning. It's 2nd place's job to beat down 1st place, but they refuse to do so. You're left with these not-so-great options:

* Beat down 1st, greatly improving 2nd place's chance to win.
* Ignore the situation, likely allowing 1st place to win unimpeded. 

But if beating down 1st place HELPS you, then the game is more likely to naturally balance out.

Another thing designers should try to do is **NOT put over and under powered factions in the game.** Now, balancing these games perfectly is basically impossible, but they should try to get them as close to balanced as they can. This removes the need for players to impose their own balance in the game until someone starts running away with it.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the popularity of Root, I&amp;#39;ve been seeing this come up a lot lately, especially in regards to the Vagabond (who the players need to beat down on to prevent them from winning) and the Lizards (who the players need to all but ignore for them to have a chance at winning).&lt;/p&gt;

I strongly recommend listening to Mark's entire thoughts on the subject - it ends at 29:16 of the podcast, so it is a little under 8 minutes.

Essentially, Mark is highly critical by the game Manitoba and the way in which it depicts the Cree (First Nations) people and the assertion that the Cree crafted totem poles - the Cree people did not in fact craft totem poles, which bear deep cultural and spiritual significance. Some of my favorite quotes from Mark's soliloquy:

* The fact that a publisher, any publisher, anywhere, from any country, would seek to use a religious or spiritually significant artifact and practice as dressing in a game and they can't even be bothered to read the first couple paragraphs from Wikipedia about a given practice, that, I think, indicates a level of intellectual laziness that I find in the abstract unsustainable; and in the particular, I think it shows a certain degree of contempt, and that contempt is what is bothersome.
* ... It is professionally contemptuous to put out a product like this, and I think they deserve to be ashamed about *that* if nothing else.
* (quoting from BGG) This would be like the Bavarians building Stonehenge. 
* ... as a board-gamer, I am ashamed that a man like Reiner Stockhausen, who has a legitimate profile in our hobby can get away with crap like this, or thinks he can get away with crap like this, and this level of carelessness, and sloppiness, and intellectual laziness.

I think Mark is spot on in his criticism of Manitoba and the entire group behind it. Mark urges for a deeper and more meaningful conversation on the topic of cultural appropriation (I think Manitoba goes beyond just appropriation) in board gaming, and if you feel the urge to begin that deeper discussion here I welcome you to it.

It has quietly remained in the top 100 for years. Published in 2005 by Eagle-Gryphon Games, Railways of the World has grown into a respectable system of boards and expansions that can satisfy just about anyone. The most recent edition, Railways of the World 10th Anniversary, has an MSRP of 99.99.

1. **Railways is great with 2-6 players.** The base game comes with two boards: Railways of Mexico and Railways of Eastern US. Mexico can be played with 2-4 players (best with 2 or 3) in about 2 hours, and Eastern US is best with 4-6 for something that can run closer to 3 hours with 6 players. Both boards offer a great experience and the Eastern US board can be combined with the Western US expansion to offer a truly epic railway game. You want more expansions? They have Europe, North America, Great Britain, Ant-freaking-arctica, and Nippon (which can also be purchased as a 2nd base game.) You can even play Railways through Time. That sound is your brain matter hitting the wall.

2. **Railways feels a lot like Power Grid meets Brass** without as much frustration from having someone steal your city spot in Power Grid and without the nail-biting resource dependence of Brass. It's hard not to draw comparisons between the two games. Both are about connecting cities, both have auction elements, but where Power Grid has resource management, Railways has debt management. In Railways, you try to limit the amount of debt you incur while still trying to maximize your income and VP.

3. **It's a wonderful blend of player interaction and building your own empire.** There are no take-that mechanisms. No real way of being stopped with what you want to do on your turn. You control your destiny. Like in Brass, players can use each other's links, but in this game, using someone's track costs you and benefits them. In short, you can play this game and still be friends afterward.

4. The game has a built in mechanism to help stop runaway leaders, and since everything is open information, **it is hard to have a lopsided victory.** You'll rarely feel like you're trapped in a 2 hr game without a chance of winning. The more VP you have, the less income you earn after a certain point. So while you're rewarded for doing well, at some point the game can turn on you.

5. **Each round will present you with many interesting choices.** With only 3 actions each turn, you have to decide whether to lay track, upgrade your engine, deliver goods, urbanize, or buy cards. This may seem like only a few choices, but the *timing* is key. Being the first to deliver a cube along from between specific cities can net you more points. Also, accomplishing your secretive objective can net you more points at the end of the game.

6. **You have to take the auctioning seriously.** If you're not an aggressive auction player, or don't care much for the mechanic, you might want to pass on this game. Getting the more powerful cards (like the double action card) in the auction can make a huge difference, and if you don't get them you need to make the player who does pay severely for them.

7. **This game has paper money and the tiles are a bit small.** If paper money (even high quality paper as this game has) drives you absolutely bananas, you will either have to supply replacements with coins (or something else) or not buy the game. The tiles work well enough, but sometimes you wish the board looked a little more organized or tidy.

8. **Railways allows far more creativity than TtR.** The maps are an open grid allowing you to build over mountains, rivers, ice, and plains. You get to build your tracks in any way you see fit rather than following pre-designed tracks. 

9. **This is a great intro into solid medium-weight Euro gaming.** Deep but not too deep. Easy to teach and somewhat forgiving. If you have friends who love TtR and Catan, but are ready for the next step up, Railways is something to consider. With a rule book about 5 pages long, you can teach this game to anyone and have them be relatively competitive in their first play. Too much inefficiency can sink you, but it's not a heavy punishing game. 

10. **Replayability is a mixed bag.** Cubes will be randomly placed on cities each game forcing players to adjust to where they can deliver goods. Different cards will come out each game. But, again like Power Grid, by and large your strategies will be similar from game to game, and it's the map expansions that offer greater replayability if you find yourself tiring of the same board. Railways expansions also introduce new cards, barons, and sometimes new types of terrain and rule tweaks.

I hope this helps you decide if this is a game for you. I really enjoy it and it is definitely my go to train game.

Next week we will discuss **Deception: Murder in Hong Kong.**

It&amp;#39;s not a super sexy game miniature game. It&amp;#39;s theme is hard to view as anything but &amp;quot;yet another train game.&amp;quot; But I think it merits more attention and more love from the board game community. It has quietly remained in the top 100 for years. Published in 2005 by Eagle-Gryphon Games, Railways of the World has grown into a respectable system of boards and expansions that can satisfy just about anyone. The most recent edition, Railways of the World 10th Anniversary, has an MSRP of 99.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Railways is great with 2-6 players.&lt;/strong&gt; The base game comes with two boards: Railways of Mexico and Railways of Eastern US. Mexico can be played with 2-4 players (best with 2 or 3) in about 2 hours, and Eastern US is best with 4-6 for something that can run closer to 3 hours with 6 players. Both boards offer a great experience and the Eastern US board can be combined with the Western US expansion to offer a truly epic railway game. You want more expansions? They have Europe, North America, Great Britain, Ant-freaking-arctica, and Nippon (which can also be purchased as a 2nd base game.) You can even play Railways through Time. That sound is your brain matter hitting the wall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I'm /u/GeebusNZ and for the last several years, I've been working on making my dream of a TCG-style game inspired by 6-button 90s arcade fighting games come true. Well, I'm most of the way there. I've been touring tabletop game conventions and major fighting game events in New Zealand to build community, but it's slow going and a small audience.

Final Round: Fight and how it works is: Every move has its own card. Your Deck has up to 6 copies of any given Basic Attack, and up to 3 copies of any Special. If you attack with a move and it hits, you do Damage; removing cards from your opponents Deck. Landing a hit means you can play a Combo and increase the number of cards your opponent loses. You keep yourself safe by playing Blocks and faster moves to dodge out of incoming attacks. When you draw cards, you draw from the damage you've taken (red health), but if you burn yourself out before you do your opponent, you'll suffer the consequences as you have to draw from your Deck.

Cards have how fast they are (Attack Speed), the maximum speed of the next card in the combo (Combo Speed), and how many cards your opponent loses from their Deck when they're hit with a move by itself or in a combo (Damage). Mix in some special effects for flavor, and you've pretty much got it. Some moves are shared, some are usable only ever by one character.

High, Mid, and Low zones are for where you're attacking on your opponent or what distance you're attacking from (some characters have extra effects from cards being played in the right zone at the right time). The Basic Block card always comes back so you can always defend yourself. Special Attacks used at your opponent turn into Meter, which you spend to use your characters Ultimate Attacks.

Two characters are available for play right now, with more on the way. Lea, the fiery girl who likes to get into fights, and Tetsuya, the cool-headed master and bearer of The Blade of the North Wind.

Choose your character. Use their moves. Play. Fight. Win!

I know a majority of folks here likely don't run or belong to something as formal as a gaming club, but for me personally, my club is one of the only reasons I play board games regularly these days. 

I started back into hobby games through some co-workers several years ago. We would play games on our lunch break and it really got me back into hobby gaming (something I had done years ago). When I switched jobs, I no longer had access to a lunch group, so I organized a little Facebook Group called ""It's Made of Meeples!"" and invited my old co-workers to join. We would gather every now and then after work at a local brewery to play some games and it was good. Somehow that group began to grow - people started inviting other friends and the group ballooned in size. Now I find myself hosting game nights for strangers (new friends) about once every other week. 

Lately I've started becoming more formal with how the group works. We generally meet on Wednesdays (or the occasional Tuesday) and we focus each game night to be either a lighter/party game night, a heavy game night, or a family game night. If we get on a bit of a more consistent schedule, I'm going to work with one of our local breweries to host it in a more official capacity on one of those evenings. The reason we picked Wednesdays is because it's often a dead day for the breweries and we don't have to worry about hogging table space - plus we bring in regular business to them. 

Anyways, any of you run your own group? How did it start, how do you run it, and any advice to those that would want to start their own?

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of **[Miniature Market](https://www.miniaturemarket.com/)**, the popular St. Louis-based online retailer known for its awesome customer hold program and robust brick-and-mortar presence.

Miniature Market has generously donated a $75 gift card for today’s giveaway. Thanks to them for their generosity!

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question, which is a popular one in the sub:

**How’d you find your game group?** (It's okay if you don't have a dedicated group -- just say that as your response.)

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

Miniature Market ships WORLDWIDE. 

##The fine print

Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

With one small child and another on the way, gaming time is scarce right now and I really want to be able to play games like Gloomhaven over multiple sessions.

The trouble with that is that we have a cat, not to mention the small child, and I very much doubt the game would sit there undisturbed.  


Has anyone come up with a good creative solution for being able to leave boardgames out between play sessions without them getting knocked around? It seems like the obvious solution is a legit boardgame table with a removable top but boy are they expensive as heck and I'm not sure I have the time or skills to follow the DIY video for building one myself.

I was thinking of making a table topper because it looks super easy, but I realized a topper doesn&amp;#39;t really suit my needs. With one small child and another on the way, gaming time is scarce right now and I really want to be able to play games like Gloomhaven over multiple sessions.

If you didn’t win, you can still order all of these games right now through the [North Sea Epilogues Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shem/the-north-sea-epilogues-rpg-raiders-play-mat) currently underway. Show Shem and Garphill some thanks for their contribution to /r/boardgames 10-year celebrations!

And now, here are the winners, with their answers to the giveaway question:

* /u/submaximal wins a copy of **Raiders of the North Sea** with both of its expansions (Fields of Fame and Hall of Heroes), and a fancy collector’s box to hold it all.

&gt; This is a tough question.

&gt; For me, it's Battle Line. Not only does it fit in a tiny pouch, but (when sleeved) it's one of the most perfectly portable, sit-down-and-have-a-beer-style games out there. Its perfect balance of making and breaking plans, its evocative but not obtrusive art, and the bold line of skittles between you and your opponent make it feel cozy, inviting, bold, and exciting - all at the same time.

* /u/AntlionC4 wins a copy of **Explorers of the North Sea** along with the Rocks of Ruin expansion.

&gt; The game never leaving my shelves is Kingdom Builder. I like to think of it having the chess mechanics in the fact we can play a casual game or you can have unlimited strategy in it. We have had games lasting between 20 mins &amp; 3 hours. The 3 hours was super intense and i came in a close second

The reason I ask this question is because I recently thought about my gateway game, which was ""Coup"", a few years ago.  But when I looked at other people's answers, many say D&amp;D, or Monopoly.  I'm in my 40's now, and can say that I had pleasant, positive memories of Monopoly, and was profoundly impacted by D&amp;D.  Although I cite ""Coup"" as what hooked me into boardgaming a few years ago, I'm thinking the seed of imaginative, tabletop gaming was planted in my youth.

Perhaps others have similar experiences and the same can be said about playing MTG, or Risk or Axis and Allies as a youth... but then discovering the dawn of videogames through the 80's, 90's, 00's.... or moving on to other interests like dating, or University, or having kids ... ie a hiatus lasting years, only to believe that a more modern gateway game drew you into the hobby when REALLY...  it was a seed that was planted years before that was simply lying dormant?  What does this say about our friends and neighbours that we are trying to recruit into the hobby later in life, should we focus our efforts?

AP is where a player over analyses a situation and slows the game down. I'm specifically talking about situations where players only start considering their turn at the beginning of their turn. I'm sure we've all encountered situations like this:

**Player A:** Okay, I'm going to discard a card and take five money. Your turn Player B.

**Player B:** I'm glad you did that, because I'm going to place a worker here and score ten victory points. Your turn Player C.

**Player C:** Well I was going to pass, but as no-one has blocked the extra worker spot, I'm going there instead. Your turn Player D.

**Player D:** Oh it's my turn? Right. Let me seeeeeeeeeee........

I actually don't mind AP. Sometimes a game can become very complex and a player needs more time to sift through the options. I've been there.

But players who don't use other's turns to think about their choices are (in my view) not respecting the other players at the table. I appreciate there are some games where this is difficult (Five Tribes for example) but there are many games where pre-planning is easy, especially those with low levels of interaction.

It'd be useful to have (polite) term for this behaviour, so it can be pointed out and hopefully addressed in a friendly manner.

**EDIT:** There's a fair few assumptions in this thread that I must be talking about a close friend and therefore that I should just 'relax', 'chill out' and enjoy their company. However that's incorrect. 

I regularly game with a group of about 50 gamers and a couple of people in the group are notorious for this behaviour. It need to be addressed as it is causing some resentment in the rest of the group, which is a shame. Not just for the group but the individuals involved, who I suspect are completely oblivious to the how others are feeling about them. I'm not close to them at all, so I just wanted a polite way to address this without causing any offence. Ironically, both individuals enjoy strategic Euro games, where this behaviour has a bigger impact on the flow of the game.

They aren't inexperienced, lacking in confidence, exhibiting any symptoms of mental illness, looking at their phones, teaching the game, bantering with others or anything else that would obviously explain or excuse this behaviour. They just simply don't think to plan ahead on every single turn and it's affecting the enjoyment of the games for others.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s not analysis paralysis.

&lt;p&gt;They aren&amp;#39;t inexperienced, lacking in confidence, exhibiting any symptoms of mental illness, looking at their phones, teaching the game, bantering with others or anything else that would obviously explain or excuse this behaviour. They just simply don&amp;#39;t think to plan ahead on every single turn and it&amp;#39;s affecting the enjoyment of the games for others.&lt;/p&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Two opponents face off across a 'battle line' and attempt to win the battle by taking 5 of 9 flags or 3 adjacent flags. Flags are decided by placing cards into 3 card poker-type hands on either side of the flag (similar to straight flush, 3 of a kind, straight, flush, etc). The side with the highest 'formation' of cards wins the flag.

This is a rethemed version of Schotten Totten with different graphics and wooden flag bits in place of the boundary stone cards.  Game play is identical, except the cards run from 1 to 10 (not 9), you hold seven cards in your hand (not 6), and the rule that stones may only be claimed at the start of your turn is presented as an ""advanced variant"". Also the tactics cards were introduced by Battle Line; these cards were only added to later editions of Schotten-Totten.

Some have reported that the production quality of the cards is inferior to the Schotten Totten cards, however, for most readers Battle Line will be much easier to find in stores.  In the second edition of GMT's Battle Line the card quality is higher.

* **Designer:** John Fiorillo, Justin Gary

* **Publisher:** Stone Blade Entertainment

* **Year Released:** 2010

* **Game Mechanic:** Deck Building, Card Drafting, Hand Management

* **Number of Players:** 2-4 (best with 2)

* **Playing Time:** 30 minutes

* **Expansions:** [Storm of Souls](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/108784/ascension-storm-of-souls), [Immortal Heroes](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/122294/ascension-immortal-heroes), [Return of the Fallen]( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/95064/ascension-return-of-the-fallen), [Rise of Vigil](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/138233/ascension-rise-of-vigil)

Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer is a deckbuilding game in which players acquire cards from a shared deck, but only 6 cards of it are revealed at a time.  In the deck are cards that players may buy to add to their deck which will either be heroes or constructs (constructs stay in front of the player when played to provide an ongoing bonus), as well as monsters that players may attack and defeat to gain a bonus.  Whoever has the most victory points between monsters defeated and cards bought/played at the end of the game wins.

&lt;p&gt;Ascension: Chronicle of the Godslayer is a deckbuilding game in which players acquire cards from a shared deck, but only 6 cards of it are revealed at a time.  In the deck are cards that players may buy to add to their deck which will either be heroes or constructs (constructs stay in front of the player when played to provide an ongoing bonus), as well as monsters that players may attack and defeat to gain a bonus.  Whoever has the most victory points between monsters defeated and cards bought/played at the end of the game wins.&lt;/p&gt;

Coimbra is a 2-4 player game published by Eggertspiele, designed by Flaminia Brasini and Virginio Gigli, and game artwork by Chris Quilliams and takes 60-90 minutes to play.

So lets hop right in, and visit Coimbra during the 15th and 16th century.

Portugal is thriving under its leading role during the Age of Discovery. Nestled in the heart of Portugal, the city of Coimbra serves as a cultural center of the country. As the head of one of Coimbra’s oldest houses, you seek to earn prestige by deepening relationships with nearby monasteries or funding expeditions of the era. To reach this goal, you must vie for the favors of the city’s most influential citizens, even if you must offer a bit of coin or some protective detail.

&amp;#x200B;

***How the game works:***

Coimbra is a dice drafting game at its core, with a couple twists. The board itself is divided into a few areas. The leftmost section is where you will be drafting and placing your dice into 4 different city sections, the castle at the top, then the upper city, mid city, and finally the lower city.

The castle section gives you a game token if drafted that will either give you resources, or a game effect, they will also have crows on them that will assist you in securing the first player spot. These are returned at the end of each round. In the castle section, dice are resolved in ascending order. Meaning, a die with 1 pip value will be resolved before a die with a 6 pip value.

The city sections will each have 4 cards in their pool to draft from. Each with a colour matching one of the influence tracks found on the rightmost section of the board that you will use to collect income, move your pilgrim or collect victory points. These 3 sections are resolved in descending order. Meaning, a die with 6 pip value will be resolved before a die with a 1 pip value.

When resolving the drafted dice, the pip value showing is what you’ll be paying to purchase the card in that city area. Meaning, if you’ve draft a 6 value on a die to ensure you’ll be able to select first, you’ll have to spend either 6 guards, or 6 coins, depending on the demand of the card, as the cost.

Then you resolve the card from top to bottom, increasing your influence on whichever track matches the card you purchased, and but however much influence is on the card. Then the bottom portion of the card will have a section that is either resolved immediately, during phase c, or e, or for end game scoring. This cards will also sometimes have scrolls on them, these scrolls are for set collecting, worth victory points at the end of the game.

In the centre of the board, you will find the city map where you will have your pilgrim visit different monasteries to gain different immediate rewards, like resources, or advancements on the influence track or to collect additional scrolls for your set collection.

On the right most side of the board, you have your influence tracks. You have coins, which is orangey-yellow, guards or shields which is green. Those two are the games currency. Then you have the pilgrim movement track in purple and lastly victory points track in green.

Based on which colour of dice you drafted, you will gain income on that influence track for the round in the amount shown by where your token is and for each of the three dice draft. So if you drafted two orangey-yellow dice, and one green die. You will gain coin income twice, the pip value doesn’t matter, and then you will gain victory points once. If you’ve drafted the white die, you can choose any track to gain income on.

Lastly, at the very bottom of the board, you have a series of voyages. Each round, you can pay to sponsor a voyage. These are end game goals that will generate victory points for you.

At the end of the fourth round, you will count up all victory points, and whoever has the most is the winner!

&amp;#x200B;

***What I thought:***  
Okay, so, as you all know, I love me a good euro. This game is a great euro. I played it once at Origins, and then again at Gen Con. I was sold at Origins, but with anything in the 70 dollar price range, I want to make sure it’s not just the flash. I played it again at Gen Con and without a doubt loved it. I preordered it from my local store and it came in last week.

Let’s get the obvious thing out of the way. This game is BEAUTIFUL. The colours are beyond bright. The component quality is fantastic. The card stock is printed on a beautiful linen card stock with really bright and crisp print quality and the custom insert is great, though it does seem like there is a LOT of wasted space if you put all the tokens in their rightful spots. As a vertical stacker. The insert isn’t really important to me as I bag everything, but if that thing is something you enjoy, this one is great! Just don’t tip it, nothing will stay in place haha.

So at first glance, this game is REALLY busy looking. But I think that seems to be a trend with new games, the era of MS paint looking games is over. The business on this board doesn’t really takes away from the enjoyment of the game as the boards have very clear iconography, so you can clearly see which cards or tiles trigger which influence track.

One thing I do have to say about the design. They really missed out on a good opportunity for double layered boards for the income track. Much like Azul and Terraforming Mars, they should have followed in the footsteps of games like Scythe. One bump of the table and it’s nearly impossible to remember where your cubes were on your income tracks. It’s definitely not a make it or break it situation, but really, these things need to be considered when using personal boards to track resources rather than actual coins or pieces to represent the currency you have.

Now to get into what I enjoyed about the game play. Replayability is huge when it comes to the life of a game, and if it gets boring over time. Coimbra has different cards, tokens and score tracks for every game you play. Which means you will likely never see the same combination of cards and tokens. This means that everytime you play, you can try for a slightly different strategy. I love this in a game. Of course the core of the game remains the same, but you might not have the same voyages for end game scoring, or maybe there are better tracks to gain VPs on.

Because of this variance, the path to victory is never really that obvious. So you really have to work your strategy every time to play. Mind you, I’ve only played but a few times now, so I haven’t had the opportunity to test every strategy,  but it seems like focusing on any of the influence tracks can yield lots of victory points.

My favourite part of the game was the unique way of using dice to collect income. It really throws a whole other layer into the game you’re playing. You may really want a 6 face on a die to be the first to get a card in that city area, but it might be in a colour of die that you really don’t need or want income from. It’s a really cool idea and one that I don’t remember seeing in any other games I’ve played. It’s hard to find original ideas with so many games being released. So I enjoyed being able to discover something new and innovative to play.

I’ve only played the game at 4 player count, however, the mechanic used when you have less than 4 players is a neat one. You’ll add dice tokens to the drafted city areas on setup. Based on their pip value, they will automatically take the card away that increases an influence track the most when there are no dice of a higher value to the left of them. This seems like a good way to ensure that people are still using their highest valued dice to get cards they want.

However, it does also allow you to plan and see if the card you want will be removed. So if you know that the card will still be there, you won’t draft a high valued die, why pay more than you need to? So that part kinda doesn’t do it for me, though I’m not sure if there’s a better way. Maybe rolling a D4 to randomize the removal?

Overall, I had a blast playing this game, it feels different every time and isn’t very difficult to teach, but the strategy is deep. I am also really enjoying this more recent trend towards Euros that are just as visually appealing as they are fun to play. As someone that loves mid to heavy weight euros, it’s been sometimes hard to find a really good euro that is also visually appealing.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;The audio review, if you&amp;#39;d rather listen than read, can be found here: &lt;a href=""https://theboarddame.com/2018/09/19/coimbra/""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Podcast&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

If you’ve drafted the white die, you can choose any track to gain income on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, at the very bottom of the board, you have a series of voyages. Each round, you can pay to sponsor a voyage. These are end game goals that will generate victory points for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the fourth round, you will count up all victory points, and whoever has the most is the winner!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;What I thought:&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
Okay, so, as you all know, I love me a good euro. This game is a great euro. I played it once at Origins, and then again at Gen Con. I was sold at Origins, but with anything in the 70 dollar price range, I want to make sure it’s not just the flash. I played it again at Gen Con and without a doubt loved it. I preordered it from my local store and it came in last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s get the obvious thing out of the way. This game is BEAUTIFUL. The colours are beyond bright. The component quality is fantastic. The card stock is printed on a beautiful linen card stock with really bright and crisp print quality and the custom insert is great, though it does seem like there is a LOT of wasted space if you put all the tokens in their rightful spots. As a vertical stacker. The insert isn’t really important to me as I bag everything, but if that thing is something you enjoy, this one is great! Just don’t tip it, nothing will stay in place haha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So at first glance, this game is REALLY busy looking. But I think that seems to be a trend with new games, the era of MS paint looking games is over. The business on this board doesn’t really takes away from the enjoyment of the game as the boards have very clear iconography, so you can clearly see which cards or tiles trigger which influence track.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I do have to say about the design. They really missed out on a good opportunity for double layered boards for the income track. Much like Azul and Terraforming Mars, they should have followed in the footsteps of games like Scythe. One bump of the table and it’s nearly impossible to remember where your cubes were on your income tracks. It’s definitely not a make it or break it situation, but really, these things need to be considered when using personal boards to track resources rather than actual coins or pieces to represent the currency you have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now to get into what I enjoyed about the game play. Replayability is huge when it comes to the life of a game, and if it gets boring over time. Coimbra has different cards, tokens and score tracks for every game you play. Which means you will likely never see the same combination of cards and tokens. This means that everytime you play, you can try for a slightly different strategy. I love this in a game. Of course the core of the game remains the same, but you might not have the same voyages for end game scoring, or maybe there are better tracks to gain VPs on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this variance, the path to victory is never really that obvious. So you really have to work your strategy every time to play. Mind you, I’ve only played but a few times now, so I haven’t had the opportunity to test every strategy,  but it seems like focusing on any of the influence tracks can yield lots of victory points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite part of the game was the unique way of using dice to collect income. It really throws a whole other layer into the game you’re playing. You may really want a 6 face on a die to be the first to get a card in that city area, but it might be in a colour of die that you really don’t need or want income from. It’s a really cool idea and one that I don’t remember seeing in any other games I’ve played. It’s hard to find original ideas with so many games being released. So I enjoyed being able to discover something new and innovative to play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve only played the game at 4 player count, however, the mechanic used when you have less than 4 players is a neat one. You’ll add dice tokens to the drafted city areas on setup. Based on their pip value, they will automatically take the card away that increases an influence track the most when there are no dice of a higher value to the left of them. This seems like a good way to ensure that people are still using their highest valued dice to get cards they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, it does also allow you to plan and see if the card you want will be removed. So if you know that the card will still be there, you won’t draft a high valued die, why pay more than you need to? So that part kinda doesn’t do it for me, though I’m not sure if there’s a better way. Maybe rolling a D4 to randomize the removal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall, I had a blast playing this game, it feels different every time and isn’t very difficult to teach, but the strategy is deep. I am also really enjoying this more recent trend towards Euros that are just as visually appealing as they are fun to play. As someone that loves mid to heavy weight euros, it’s been sometimes hard to find a really good euro that is also visually appealing.&lt;/p&gt;

So for the last week, I've tried to be a part of the community more. That said, for **FULL DISCLOSURE:** I am a friend of one of the developers for this project.

Guild Master is essentially a 2-4 player competitive engine building game where players simultaneously issue out orders to members of their guild to either complete contracts, hire more adventurers or upgrade their guild. Completing orders will consist of taking part in auctions, negotiations, dice rolls and utilizing special powers at the right time according to the waxing/waning moon. There are heaps of ways to strategize.

After 9 turns, the guild with the most fame accrued through completing various tasks is the winner. 

A better rundown of the game can be found at:

At 48 hours left in the campaign, the game is currently just shy of its last current stretch goal for some pretty looking guild screens, so here's a link to it if you're interested!

I haven’t played through the campaign but I’m curious what the best way to schedule it.

I plan on running five sessions one for each chapter, but I don’t know how long to plan for each chapter.  Will each game really take an hour?  If I schedule five three hour blocks that is a lot of time but I’d say the games can be run in 2.5 hours or such that would be better on my moderator.

Also since it is a convention setting I expect players to file in and out throughout the five sessions.  Can the legacy version be played with different players or will missing certain chapters screw you over?

Lastly if players drop out of a session are you able to continue the story with more/less players even if chapter one had 9 players but maybe chapter 2 has 13 players?

Any other helpful information would be useful.  Thanks.

I've tried introducing this game to a number of friends and family but never actually gotten it to the table more than once with the same group. This has meant that I've had to explain the rules every time I've found someone willing to play it with me which can be quite daunting. 

To me Terra Mystica really isn't that difficult to understand once you've heard the rules and played through the first round. It's getting to that part that's the challenge. Often times I see everyone's eyes glaze over when faced with all of the different components as they begin questioning what the hell they've gotten themselves into. Me frantically repeating ""It's not really very difficult! You'll get it in just a minute!"" never really seemed to help. 

So the dilemma of teaching the game coupled with the fact that it does take a few hours to play had made me wary of trying to introduce it to my current gaming group. But since it is the only game left on my 10x10 for 2018 I thought it was high time to give it a shot. Which I did, yesterday.

And it was a complete SUCCESS! They listened carefully during the rules and asked questions when confused. By the end of the first round everyone knew how to play and were having fun. Turned out to be a real nailbiter too. Everyone were within 5 points of each other when the game ended. Afterwards we talked about how fun it was and when we could play again which means that I might actually complete the 10x10!

It was a great game night and I wanted to share! I'm thrilled to finally be able to play Terra Mystica with the same people more than once. 

Does anyone else have a similar story? Any games you're wary of introducing or just can't get people to play with you? Please share!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been playing boardgames with some friends once a week for the past six months or so. During this time we&amp;#39;ve played almost all of my games with the exception of &lt;strong&gt;Terra Mystica&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve tried introducing this game to a number of friends and family but never actually gotten it to the table more than once with the same group. This has meant that I&amp;#39;ve had to explain the rules every time I&amp;#39;ve found someone willing to play it with me which can be quite daunting. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me Terra Mystica really isn&amp;#39;t that difficult to understand once you&amp;#39;ve heard the rules and played through the first round.

My coworker and I have begun a podcast and wanted to share with you. It's available on all major platforms (not quite SoundCloud due to issues but bear with us).

I am a game enthusiast and my partner in the show, Jair, is very new. We take both perspectives as we talk about games. This episode we talk about **Carcassonne** **High Society** and **Scythe Rise of Fenris Chapter 2** (we did some spoilers of chapter 1 but overall it's very minimal on those). Then after a tea break, we discuss our own board game in a developer diary sort of situation. We are working on a euro style drafting worker placement game based on camp counselors in a summer camp.

https://youtu.be/o2ZyrCVvQ6E

We'd love if you gave a listen and told us what you think.

We record every Wednesday, and we take comments and questions as well if you have any. We're doing a community topic question this week asking ""What game are you dying to play but haven't got to the table yet?""

This episode we talk about &lt;strong&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;High Society&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Scythe Rise of Fenris Chapter 2&lt;/strong&gt; (we did some spoilers of chapter 1 but overall it&amp;#39;s very minimal on those). Then after a tea break, we discuss our own board game in a developer diary sort of situation. We are working on a euro style drafting worker placement game based on camp counselors in a summer camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://youtu.be/o2ZyrCVvQ6E""&gt;https://youtu.be/o2ZyrCVvQ6E&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;d love if you gave a listen and told us what you think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We record every Wednesday, and we take comments and questions as well if you have any. We&amp;#39;re doing a community topic question this week asking &amp;quot;What game are you dying to play but haven&amp;#39;t got to the table yet?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and appreciate any comments, criticisms, and support!&lt;/p&gt;

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of **[Garphill Games](http://garphill.com/)**, which publishes the North Sea series, including the well-regarded **Raiders of the North Sea.** Garphill is also currently running a [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/shem/the-north-sea-epilogues-rpg-raiders-play-mat/description) for its North Sea Epilogues RPG and an enticing-looking playmat for Raiders of the North Sea. 

Shem Phillips has been exceptionally generous, offering the following prizes up for today’s giveaway:

* A copy of [Raiders of the North Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170042/raiders-north-sea), along with both of its expansions (Fields of Fame and Hall of Heroes), and a fancy collector’s box to hold it all!
* A copy of [Explorers of the North Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/176371/explorers-north-sea), along with the Rocks of Ruin expansion!

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What game will never leave your shelf, even if you never get to play it again?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship WORLDWIDE. Thanks again to Shem for this generous offer.

##The fine print

Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help mark &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9g1jg3/happy_10th_birthday_rboardgames/""&gt;10 years of /r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;, we’re hosting a series of great giveaways from some of your favorite designers, publishers, and retailers!&lt;/p&gt;

Congratulations to the winners of yesterday's giveaways, sponsored by [Czech Games Edition](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9gkaas/10_years_of_rboardgames_10_days_of_giveaways_day/) and [Leder Games](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9gkabx/10_years_of_rboardgames_10_days_of_giveaways_day/)! Here are the winners, with their answers to the giveaway question:

* /u/thequeenshand wins a copy of **That’s a Question!**

&gt; For me it was Secret Hitler. I had a boyfriend a while back who basically re-introduced me to Settlers of Catan, and we played a whole lot of it! That got me thinking about whether there was a boardgames sub here on Reddit, and I found it pretty much immediately. I looked at some recommended games and I came across Secret Hitler!

&gt; I was always a fan of role playing games, and I loved the hidden role aspect of it so I bought it and now me and my friends are hooked! After that I bought among others Mysterium and Exploding Kittens (by the same company, it's awesome!).

* /u/BoltKey wins a copy of **Codenames XXL**

&gt; Port Royal. Although I have learned a lot since, and see that there are much better games to play, it was the first game that I really liked.

* /u/paranoidQ wins a copy of **Pulsar 2849**

&gt; Perhaps strangely, as I don't play it much anymore, was Risk: Gods War - a spin on a game I played quite a bit in my teens that added an extra dimension.

&gt; That and Agricola which we played the most soon after.

* /u/lovelace- wins a copy of **Adrenaline**

&gt; I played Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne back in the day, but my real gateway game was Pandemic. After playing Pandemic board games became one of my hobbies.

* /u/seabutcher wins a copy of **Pictomania**

&gt; Pandemic was a milestone for me. After growing up on Chess and Monopoly, years later I learned Magic: The Gathering with some friends and then started going to tournaments at a game shop, where I first discovered the sheer wealth of boardgames available. At some point in this my curiousity was piqued, and I'd ended up playing a few things I saw like Munchkin and Cards Against Humanity but it wasn't until I stumbled across a review of Pandemic, bought a copy and introduced it to my family that I really became the kind of boardgamer I am today.

* /u/BSUGrad1 wins a copy of **Root** 

&gt; That would definitely be HeroQuest. Up to the first play of that, I had just played the old standards. But the RPG like qualities were something I hadn't seen outside of Video Games. Got me into the hobby.

And the following users will each receive a code for copies of the digital implementations of **Galaxy Trucker** and **Through the Ages**:

* /u/Nattytom501
* /u/realbrat
* /u/fortycakes
* /u/invisibleswede
* /u/commissionerbourbon

That got me thinking about whether there was a boardgames sub here on Reddit, and I found it pretty much immediately. I looked at some recommended games and I came across Secret Hitler!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was always a fan of role playing games, and I loved the hidden role aspect of it so I bought it and now me and my friends are hooked! After that I bought among others Mysterium and Exploding Kittens (by the same company, it&amp;#39;s awesome!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/BoltKey""&gt;/u/BoltKey&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Codenames XXL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Port Royal. Although I have learned a lot since, and see that there are much better games to play, it was the first game that I really liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/paranoidQ""&gt;/u/paranoidQ&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Pulsar 2849&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps strangely, as I don&amp;#39;t play it much anymore, was Risk: Gods War - a spin on a game I played quite a bit in my teens that added an extra dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That and Agricola which we played the most soon after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/lovelace-""&gt;/u/lovelace-&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Adrenaline&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I played Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne back in the day, but my real gateway game was Pandemic. After playing Pandemic board games became one of my hobbies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/seabutcher""&gt;/u/seabutcher&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Pictomania&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pandemic was a milestone for me. After growing up on Chess and Monopoly, years later I learned Magic: The Gathering with some friends and then started going to tournaments at a game shop, where I first discovered the sheer wealth of boardgames available. At some point in this my curiousity was piqued, and I&amp;#39;d ended up playing a few things I saw like Munchkin and Cards Against Humanity but it wasn&amp;#39;t until I stumbled across a review of Pandemic, bought a copy and introduced it to my family that I really became the kind of boardgamer I am today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/BSUGrad1""&gt;/u/BSUGrad1&lt;/a&gt; wins a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Root&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That would definitely be HeroQuest. Up to the first play of that, I had just played the old standards. But the RPG like qualities were something I hadn&amp;#39;t seen outside of Video Games. Got me into the hobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And the following users will each receive a code for copies of the digital implementations of &lt;strong&gt;Galaxy Trucker&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Through the Ages&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/Nattytom501""&gt;/u/Nattytom501&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/realbrat""&gt;/u/realbrat&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/fortycakes""&gt;/u/fortycakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/invisibleswede""&gt;/u/invisibleswede&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/commissionerbourbon""&gt;/u/commissionerbourbon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be reaching out to the winners via PM. Thanks to the more than 2,800 of you who participated, and keep an eye out for more giveaways in the days ahead!&lt;/p&gt;

#**Real life**

Hi! My name is Matthew and I am a stay at home dad and BoardGameGeek's Community Manager (username Octavian), which means I strive to get people to be excellent to one another both at home and online. Originally from WNY, I now live in CT (with a decade long stint in Pittsburgh in between for grad school). My non-gaming hobbies include a love of cooking, engaging in a constant battle against acquiring a ""dad-bod"", and following pro-wrestling and politics (their similarities seem to grow every year). I used to obsess over the NFL, but as a Bills fan I think I'll take this season off.

**How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?** 

My introduction to the world of board games came when I moved to Pittsburgh. I was a long time RPG player in high school and college, and I wanted something that scratched the itch of sitting around a table with friends, but also needed something that demanded less time, both per session and also not needing to have a consistent sustained group. I found Catan in 2000. I got competitive with my group of new friends. I searched for strategy tips and found a relatively new site called BoardGameGeek. And that's when I fell down the rabbit hole.

(As a post-script, thinking back on that origin now strikes me with the irony of currently being hooked on Gloomhaven - a game demanding a considerable time commitment and a consistent sustained group!)

#**Gaming habits**

**How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?** 

I play games once a week with a group that plays mostly euro and hybrid games. I also host a dedicated Gloomhaven group once or twice a month, and also try to host a larger Ameritrash game once every month or so. I also periodically play games with my kids (ages 5 and 9). I also get a fair bit of convention gaming in - I travel to a couple big board game conventions each year, and also attend a couple smaller local ones.

&amp;nbsp;

#**Favorites**


**What is your Favorite Game and why?** 

I'm going to cop out and give a favorite genre: highly narrative co-operative games (e.g. Gloomhaven, Eldritch Horror, 7th Continent, This War of Mine, Spirit Island, Sentinels of the Multiverse) - they most closely scratch the feel of playing an RPG. (Second favorite genre - Civ builders! I love me some Through the Ages and Clash of Cultures, among many more).

**Who is your Favorite Designer and why?** 

Reiner Knizia. The LotR co-op is a masterpiece. Blue Moon is a masterpiece. Tigris and Euphrates, Ra, Taj Mahal, Modern Art...masterpieces.

**Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?** 

FFG from ~2000-2010 - when they made massive, unabashedly AT board games. The newer focus on app-driven games is fine, but doesn't capture me the same way. The move towards more minis based skirmish games and LCGs doesn't grab me the same way their sprawling, table space consuming, 4+ hour AT epics did. 

**Favorite gaming mechanism?**

I enjoy most any game with dice-manipulation mechanics (e.g. Troyes, World of Warcraft: The Board Game, To Court the King)

**Favorite component?**

The boss figure in Mechs vs Minions. That thing is ridiculous. 

**What game can you not stand or refuse to play?** 

Another cop out by going mechanic rather than specific game, but I really really REALLY dislike games that involve blind-bidding where only one person wins but everyone pays. Thankfully that's fallen off the map as a go-to mechanic in current designs.

&amp;nbsp;

#**Versus**

|Fight! | Winner!|  
| ---------:|:----------|  
| Theme vs. Mechanics | Both! (edge to Mechanics) |  
| Long vs. Short games | Both |  
| Playing 5 games 20 times vs. 20 games 5 times| Both! |  
| Short vs. Long | Both! |  
| Euro vs. Ameritrash | Both! |  
| Competitive vs. Cooperative | Both (edge to cooperative)|
| Cubes vs. Miniatures | Both! |
| Victory by Conquest vs. Victory by Point Salad | Both! |
| Card Sleeves vs. Unsleeved | Unsleeved |
| Agricola vs. Caverna | Agricola |
| Race for the Galaxy vs. Roll for the Galaxy | Both (edge to Race) |

#**Q &amp; A**

**What does /r/boardgames mean to you?**

If BGG is my home, r/boardgames is my vacation home. I get to come here to read people's takes on games without having the background process of being responsible for keeping the peace :)

**What’s the most memorable gaming experience you’ve had?**

Most of them are RPG related. Most people don't want to hear about other people's RPG campaigns, so I'll leave it at that.

**Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?**

BGG says I have 74 games and expansions rated a 10 out of 1000+ ratings. A game is a 10 if it's something I'd always want to play, no questions asked. That doesn't mean it's a perfect game. It just means that it will always be a rip-roaring good time or an otherwise worthwhile experience. An expansion is a 10 if I consider it a must-have for anyone who likes the game, or because it fixes some issue with the base game.

**Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?**

I am an Omni-gamer. I play and enjoy euros, AT, hybrids, war games, card games, abstract games - the full spectrum. Yes - the categories are meaningful. They wouldn't be enduring categories if they weren't.


**How many games are in your collection? Are you satisfied with that number?** 

BGG says I own 345 base games. I'm slowly paring things down (I think I peaked around 400) - not because I think it's too many necessarily, but just to offload things that I don't ever see playing again.

**If you could only keep 10 games in your collection, what 10 would they be?** 

10 games to keep (no particular order):

- Go  
- Tichu  
- Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization  
- Clash of Cultures (plus expansions)  
- Spirit Island (plus expansions)  
- Blue Moon (plus expansions)  
- Sentinels of the Multiverse (plus expansions)  
- Eldritch Horror (plus expansions)  
- Dominion (plus expansions)  
- Cosmic Encounter (plus expansions)

Is ""plus expansions"" cheating? I hope not! :)
 

**Is there anything else you'd like to add?** 

All I'd like to add is how much I appreciate everything that r/boardgames brings to the board gaming community and that I am honored to have been asked to be included in the 10 year anniversary festivities! I'll be around to respond to comments and questions if there are any. And I can always be reached on BGG or through our Contact email address if anyone has any BGG related comments or concerns they'd like to get in touch with me about.

Game on!

&lt;p&gt;All I&amp;#39;d like to add is how much I appreciate everything that &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; brings to the board gaming community and that I am honored to have been asked to be included in the 10 year anniversary festivities! I&amp;#39;ll be around to respond to comments and questions if there are any. And I can always be reached on BGG or through our Contact email address if anyone has any BGG related comments or concerns they&amp;#39;d like to get in touch with me about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Game on!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here are some of the resources available at &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are new here, be sure to check out our &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/community""&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are looking for a game recommendation, make sure to read our &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig""&gt;What Should I Get Wiki&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If asking people for recommendations is too interactive: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/wsig#wiki_ask_a_robot_for_a_list_of_recommendations""&gt;The Automated Recommendations Robot is here for you&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Also take a look at our &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/index""&gt;Wiki Index&lt;/a&gt; for various other resources and information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any questions about game design can be answered here, but also visit &lt;a href=""/r/tabletopgamedesign""&gt;/r/tabletopgamedesign&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Any discussions about the subreddit itself should be contained in &lt;a href=""/r/metaboardgames""&gt;/r/metaboardgames&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Upon looking at the new kickstarter for the expansion I was a little shocked at the pricing...  Even with the reduction in cost, $39 + $12 shipping came out to be $51 just for the expansion alone.  CE is the same pricing as the first KS at $65 + $15 Shipping coming to $80. 

But looking at OFLG such as gamenerdz, it comes to only $43 + free shipping when i meet the minimum requirement (which isn't too hard).  So trying to be reasonable I compared the costs: The expansion will be more expensive than the retail base game with less ""stuff"".  The CE edition comes with a couple of goodies, but ultimately not much that I really care for except for the Extra! Extra! cards and maybe the Legendary cards (I felt balance was a little wonky), but that comes to almost double the standard retail price.

So in the end of it all I just felt disappointed in the pricing of the game and decided to not back either but to just get the retail version.  It really hurts not being able to get the extra cards in the CE (others I don't really care about), and I just cant justify the cost to do so.  Also, since it looks like the expansion is KS exclusive, it looks like I'll be missing out on it indefinitely, unless something changes.  The game is just way too overpriced FOR ME.  Unless it adds something more significant to the game or a lower price point, I am going to try to go against my FOMO and pass on it.  I feel that the base game has more than enough meat on it.  

I am not saying its unfair what they are doing or anything of that sort, but just wanted to voice my opinion on the matter.  Just a way to vent my personal feelings about the subject matter.  

I don't know what the costs of making the game or anything of the sort, but it looks like they updated their campaign recently to reduce the game from $45 to $39 previously, but had to increase their funding goal to print the game to $30,000 instead.  But it seems that they could've reduced the price down further and have the funding goal be higher, but like not sure if it'll be feasible to them.

&lt;p&gt;So we are looking for game recommendations on the print and play side. (as a new club we barely have funds and board games have like 150% tax here)(also we may have very lax laws against counterfeit but we would prefer to avoid that)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As well any advice on managing big play groups. (Not necessarily a 100 as we may limit the amount of people for the good of the club)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any and all advice!&lt;/p&gt;

As it says in the kickstarter description, in Infinities: Defiance of Fate you are the leader of a sci-fi or fantasy faction seeking to assemble an army, shape the very worlds you walk on, and fulfill or redefine your destiny. Experience a combination of accessible, tactical gameplay and rich, flexible storytelling as you forge your own timelines. 

Basically you explore hexagonal tiles (and build the game's map by doing so) and battle the other players for dominance.

The game has a lot of elements I like - dice throwing, ability cards and hand management, exploration, PVP, and a REALLY well-crafted solo experience that doesn't feel like it was just chucked in as an afterthought.

Each turn 3 decks of cards flip over with different numbers on them, and the backside of the previous card has a special effect paired with the newly flipped card.

The game plays very smooth even though it has a few rules that aren’t the most intuitive from reading but once you start playing it clicks together wonderfully.

Hello!  I'm Nathan Martin, the co-founder and GM for Wooded Realms, a new company based in Seattle Washington!  My business partner Michael Yang and I have joined forces to bring out the 2nd Breakfast Board Game Table, the first fully featured, quality board game table designed to do double duty as your gaming table and kitchen table.  Our table is made for folks who love gaming, but don't have room for a dedicated gaming space.

I'm also the Executive Director and showrunner for the Seattle Retro Gaming Expo ([www.SeattleRetro.org](https://www.SeattleRetro.org)) and I host a monthly video game pub quiz called The Question Block here in Seattle ([www.TheQuestionBlock.com](https://www.TheQuestionBlock.com)).  I've previously worked for Xbox at Microsoft, and was a Gameplay Counselor for Nintendo back in the N64/GCN days.  Games are kind of a big deal for me, so I hope to make some really cool connections today, and get people fired up about the future of Wooded Realms!

I'll be here at 9:00 AM to answer any and all questions about board game tables, board games, tables, boards, games, tables, and anything else!

Our Wooded Realms Kickstarter (Early Bird ends tomorrow): [https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/woodedrealms/2nd-breakfast-an-affordable-quality-board-game-tab](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/woodedrealms/2nd-breakfast-an-affordable-quality-board-game-tab)

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of **[Leder Games](http://ledergames.com/)**, the growing, Minnesota-based publisher of well-known games like **Vast: The Crystal Caverns** and **Root**. 

Leder Games was the very first company to get back to us about these giveaways, and didn't even think twice about offering up a prize I know a lot of you will be very excited about:

* A copy of **Root**, Cole Wehrle's asymmetric wargame that's been the talk of /r/boardgames for weeks.

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What was *your* gateway game? The game that finally convinced you that board gaming was a hobby you could be into?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship TO THE US ONLY. This is kind of an odd one -- in order to facilitate the giveaway (and because Root was selling out everywhere online), Leder Games sent the game to me last month, and I'll be sending it directly to the winner. I'm willing to subsidize some of the cost of shipping, but **the winner of this giveaway will be required to pay $10 shipping via PayPal.** Sorry for any inconvenience, but still, **Root** for $10 would definitely show up in /r/boardgamedeals.

For our other users around the world, don't worry -- we have a number of additional worldwide giveaways lined up in the days ahead.

##The fine print

Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

* A copy of [That's a Question!](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/226322/s-question)
* A copy of [Codenames XXL](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/178900/codenames)
* A copy of [Pulsar 2849](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/228341/pulsar-2849)
* A copy of [Adrenaline](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/202408/adrenaline)
* A copy of [Pictomania](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania)
* 5 codes each for digital implementations of Galaxy Trucker and Through the Ages (5 winners)

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What was *your* gateway game? The game that finally convinced you that board gaming was a hobby you could be into?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship TO THE EU ONLY.

For our other users around the world, don't worry -- we have a number of additional worldwide giveaways lined up in the days ahead.

##The fine print

Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

Things I like about Dominion:

* Building the engine of your hand. I mean that's what it's about, right? Cool combinations that allow you to have an absolutely killer turn.
* Clever cards. I've played the online version a fair amount and have found some of the cards kind of interesting or fun in their combo of art, action, and name.

Things I don't like about Dominion:

* So many expansions are awesome for card variety but horrible for someone looking to dive in. It can be overwhelming.
* Sometimes it feels too much like a race, like if I'm not optimizing from moment one I have no chance. Maybe that's just playing against the AI online, or maybe it's the nature of the beast. It's still fun, but at times it feels mechanical or mathematical.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been eyeing a certain deck-building Kickstarter (it will remain nameless, because I&amp;#39;m not trying to plug) in part because it looks neat and in part because its a genre not currently represented in my collection but one I&amp;#39;ve enjoyed when I&amp;#39;ve had a chance to play it.

&gt; Playing all night games of Monopoly during sleepovers! :)

* /u/KatAnansi wins a $100 gift card

&gt; Playing draughts with the barman, while my parents had a Friday evening drink.

* /u/pktur3 wins a $100 gift card

&gt; I fell in love with someone and boardgames at the same time. I liked boardgames at first, but after falling in love with her it became a hunger and passion.

&gt; Mage Knight was the game we played together, drinking wine, in the early morning hours with the dew still soaking the grass. We didn’t play much the first few times as we couldn’t keep our eyes off each other, but it evolved into something amazing.

&gt; Sadly, it didn’t work out between us as the realities of life tore us apart. I still think about her and what memories we could’ve made and adventures we could’ve had.

&gt; The copy of Mage Knight I have still sits gathering dust. Some sort of reminder that even loss can be beautiful and doesn’t have to end as we all can start over when we are ready to lift the lid with other players and begin again.

I'll be reaching out to the winners via PM.

It is called Black Queen - for reasons that will be apparent soon enough. It is a trick taking game with a surprising twist - the teams are dynamic.

&amp;#x200B;

It is played with a standard deck of cards, with some cards removed to make the number of cards divisible by the number of players, usually 6 or 7, although the game is very flexible. The card with the lowest values (like twos and threes) are removed first. Some cards are assigned points, as follows:-

* All aces: 15 points each
* All tens: 10 points each
* All fives: 5 points each
* Queen of Spades: 30 points

These sum up to 150. The cards are distributed among the players. The game begins with a bidding round - each player bids the amount of points that his team (not yet decided) can make, without consulting others of course. Bidding starts at 75 points and ends when all but one player has passed on. Let's say the highest bidder is Mr. X, with a bid of ""y"" points.

&amp;#x200B;

Mr. X then decides the trump and announces two cards from the entire deck - players with these cards belong to his team, and are called his ""partners"". They don't reveal themselves as partners though. If both the cards belong to the same player, he is a double partner. Mr. X can also announce cards from his own stack as well. The game then proceeds like any other trick taking game, but everyone keeps track of the number of points in the trick as well. One has to cleverly decide when to contribute points to the current trick and when not to, based on their guess of the team of Mr. X.

&amp;#x200B;

At the end of the game, if the team of Mr. X achieves their bid, all of them get a score of +3y in total, and -3y otherwise. The distribution of this score is in proportion to the number of cards in the player's stack at the beginning of the game announced by Mr.X, with one additional share for Mr. X. So if for example, Mr. X announces one card from his own stack and one other card belonging to some Mr. A, Mr. X gets +2y and Mr. A +y, if they achieve their bid.

&amp;#x200B;

This is called a round, and the game can be played for a fixed number of rounds, and the person with the highest total score wins at the end.

Thank you for reading! There is a lot of strategy required in this game, and I like such games in general. I appreciate suggestions to make this game more fun - it is a traditional indian game, with rules slightly varying across regions. What are some other games which require a lot of strategy and are playable using only a standard deck of cards? I know of one other game - Judgement.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;A friend of mine introduced me to this game recently, and I enjoyed playing it. It is called Black Queen - for reasons that will be apparent soon enough. It is a trick taking game with a surprising twist - the teams are dynamic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is played with a standard deck of cards, with some cards removed to make the number of cards divisible by the number of players, usually 6 or 7, although the game is very flexible. The card with the lowest values (like twos and threes) are removed first. Some cards are assigned points, as follows:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All aces: 15 points each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All tens: 10 points each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All fives: 5 points each&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Queen of Spades: 30 points&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These sum up to 150. The cards are distributed among the players. The game begins with a bidding round - each player bids the amount of points that his team (not yet decided) can make, without consulting others of course. Bidding starts at 75 points and ends when all but one player has passed on. Let&amp;#39;s say the highest bidder is Mr. X, with a bid of &amp;quot;y&amp;quot; points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. X then decides the trump and announces two cards from the entire deck - players with these cards belong to his team, and are called his &amp;quot;partners&amp;quot;. They don&amp;#39;t reveal themselves as partners though. If both the cards belong to the same player, he is a double partner. Mr. X can also announce cards from his own stack as well. The game then proceeds like any other trick taking game, but everyone keeps track of the number of points in the trick as well.

The distribution of this score is in proportion to the number of cards in the player&amp;#39;s stack at the beginning of the game announced by Mr.X, with one additional share for Mr. X. So if for example, Mr. X announces one card from his own stack and one other card belonging to some Mr. A, Mr. X gets +2y and Mr. A +y, if they achieve their bid.&lt;/p&gt;

I have been playing games for about a year or so now, and I have had some experiences where I have had AP, typically this happens with heavier Euros l, but it can happen in other games too. I understand that it is difficult to play a game and on player is taking longer than everyone else. I also understand that other players complaining that you are “too slow” sucks. Now I have ADHD so sometimes it is really difficult to think straight especially if I am in a noisy store or if there is something else going on simultaneously. This makes it hard to take turns fast in games where you really have to strategize. I also know that some players AP is caused by themselves not paying attention to the game when it is off of their turn. 

So I think that we can categorize people into two groups(now this is VERY BROAD, things are always more nuanced than two categories), self imposed(e.g. not paying attention) and not self imposed(e.g. ADHD or not quite understanding the game). 

We can also do the same for players who aren’t AP prone(again broad categories blah blah blah), assholes(the people who are passive aggressive/jerks towards AP players) and respectful(the people who mention it nicely, or try to help players improve their AP, either by helping to teach them the game better, or trying to remove distractions).

My advice to AP players is to understand which kind of people the non AP players, if they are the respectful type, then let them help you, and acknowledge that they are helping. If they are the asshole type, then discuss that with them, if they don’t change then stop playing with them, they will just ruin your experience. The other advice is to understand what kind of AP player you are, and finds ways to reduce your AP, watch some videos so that you understand the game, ask questions when it is not your turn, and try to minimize distractions.

My advice to non AP players is to understand your AP players. If they are the self imposed type, then talk to them about it, if they don’t change, then stop playing with them, they will just ruin your experience. If they are the non self imposed type, then see how you can help them, sometimes they are embarrassed to ask for help. If they improve then keep doing what you are doing if they don’t improve then try your best to play with them, sometimes they just can’t help it. If you can’t handle it then respectfully ask them to find another group, if you aren’t an asshole about it, then they will be more understanding about it. If they are an asshole to you then that is their problem. If they understand that the group is wanting to move quicker and they can’t then you can try to help them find a better group for them.

The moral of the story is don’t be an asshole. This whole community would be much better if we could stop complaining about each other, and try to actually fix the problems that we are having.

Just got terraforming mars and looking forward to see why it's ranked so high. I have anxiety when I think about how a game progress can be invalidated if someone knocked the table (e.g. azul's score). I looked at custom trays/overlays and the cheapest (and best one it seems) is $7.5 per player = $37.5 + tax and shipping. so that's a no go.

I have some ideas:

* **3d printing**: my local library has 3d printing access, it costs ""$0.10 per 1 gram of filament"". maybe someone who has experience can estimate how much would that be around for printing them? I have to actually attend a lecture or something and get certification to use the 3d printer, so it takes some effort.

* **acrylic**: I don't think I have the tools to cut it, and it probably takes a lot of effort

Just looking if you guys have any ideas for something that's easy/cheaper to do than what I thought of. I don't really need something that looks nice (within reason), as long as it works.

Deck-building (Dominion)

Drafting (Splendor/Bargain Quest)

Campaign Style (Mechs vs. Minions, KDM, 7th Continent)

2 Player Games (Onitama, Hive, Fox in the Forest)

Dice Dependent (Catan, Machi Koro)

Goofy/Random (Survive: Escape from Atlantis)

Territory Control (Scythe)

Multiplayer War Game (Root is my hopeful inclusion eventually)

Worker Placement (trying to decide on a Rosenburg)

For example: on the Elysian board Ecologist Milestone— must have 4 animal microbe or plant tags.

We have come across cards and milestones (Ecologist) that say you must have 4 specific tags in your deck. There are other cards that have requirements of a certain number of tags played, meaning bought the cards and played the cards. For example: on the Elysian board Ecologist Milestone— must have 4 animal microbe or plant tags. We have assumed and played with the rule that someone can claim ecologist on their first turn by having 4 of these tags in there initial playing deck, before they have played the cards. Anyone play this way?&lt;/p&gt;

On the one hand, smart, interesting gameplay with a solid theme. I don't want to write a full review, but players are competing to build, control and profit from casinos, in a sort of tile laying/area control thing. The rules are actually pretty light and elegant, and lead to solid depth of play with a number of mechanics I haven't seen before.

It might kind of clash with itself for being too smart to also be luck-based and silly. There are a lot of cool tactical and strategic considerations, but they all influence your odds in a lot of die rolls, and you might just get screwed by luck. You can also have weird outcomes to some conflicts, like one player attempting a coup against a casino controlled by another, only for an unlucky die roll to give it to a third player who was barely even involved. 

Still, all in all I love the idea and mechanics, but *why did they have to make it so cheap*. The board is small, the box is drab, the dice look like trash, there's paper money, player markers are just plastic discs, and no single component stands out as being cool or impressive. It's a game about *Vegas*. If any game should have over-the-top, even tacky components, it's this one. Give us poker chips rather than cash money, fancy dice, a big board, nice cards with some art design that mimics playing cards, a giant board with some verticality  in the components... hell, I wouldn't call them excessive if they had a felt-lined insert that doubled as a dice pit.

I love solving puzzles, building engines, and finding the optimal play both strategically and tactically. Lately, however, I haven't been enjoying them and I think I've figured out why. 

I play in a regular game group with 2-3 others about once a week. We are all evenly matched and have been playing together for years. We play a variety of styles of games from light dice-rollers to very heavy Euros. We usually have 3-4 hours available in a play session which makes the heavier games manageable, but sometimes tricky to fit into our schedule. 

Lately I've noticed that one player in particular suffers from AP a little more than the rest of us and dominates the play time. In one particular game I estimate that he took 80% of the play time in a three player game. He is also slightly more competitive than the rest of us, but not obnoxiously so. 

We are all good friends and talk about this kind of thing freely. We can also typically manage things by giving him a reasonable about of crap, in a joking manner, about his turn times. It's not an interpersonal issue for us as much as a philosophical issue about this kind of game. 

As a game becomes heavier and more strategic, the decision tree can be huge. Obviously, the more time you consider the various options and their implications, the better chance you have of winning the game. I often find myself thinking, ""I might be able to find a better move with another five minutes of thinking, but that won't be fun for the rest of the players, so I'll stick with my current move which is good enough"". This is usually fine, but sometimes is unsatisfying -- especially when I feel I've lost a game against someone who spent more time considering their strategy.

The problem is, I like when games are a battle of wits and intelligence, not time and patience. Luck/dice rolls mechanics are often used to help with AP, but they take away from the ""battle of wits"" aspect of gaming. We've thought about using timers, but I think they come with issues of their own. They can make a casual game night feel stressful for all players and the issue of enforcement is tricky. (What do you do if a player runs out of time at an inopportune moment? Forcing someone to make an obviously poor move in a long game is not fun for anyone). Have any of you had success with timers?

Has anyone found strategies that help with this? Have you solved this in your game group? Do you know if any heavy games which have a mechanic which equalizes play time or penalizes taking a disproportionate amount of time on turns?

#**Real life**

I’m Chris, founder and lead designer for Asmadi Games. We’re up near Boston (Arlington to be specific), and I’ve grown up and lived in the eastern Massachusetts area my whole life. A whole lot of that time has been devoted to playing and making games, as you may guess, but sometimes I do other things, too! Every winter I curl (at the Broomstones Curling Club in Wayland), I follow the local sports teams, sometimes play poker, frisbee, soccer…oh, those’re all games too, aren’t they? Oops.

**How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?**

I’ve been playing board games and video games since before I can remember. My parents are gamers (My dad just started a new Mario Odyssey save after getting his 999 moons), we had an Atari 400 and a Commodore 64 and plenty of classic board games, and then various other video game systems growing up. Back then, they all kind of mixed together as one “playing games” - we’d doodle board game versions of video games in elementary school and play them (super complicated roll-and-move mechanics!!), and played loooots of traditional 52-card deck card games. 
 
I started encountering euro games in college, and was pleasantly surprised to see they were adding more complexity and strategy to the tabletop realm. That was right around the first CCG boom, which are kind of like board games, in the way that EA’s latest lootbox offerings are kind of like video games! (I also remember when EA was ECA, one of my favorite game publishers)

#**Gaming habits**


**How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?**
   
I play games pretty often. Board games at least weekly, whether in person or online in TTS or native implementations, and other video games all the time as well. We play a mix between at home, at the local board game cafe (Knight Moves), at friends’ places, and of course conventions. I tend to prefer playing with people I know, when possible. I have an unfortunately strong sense of smell, which leads to zero tolerance for folks who violate the crucial law of showering (or those who smoke, sorry!) 

 &amp;nbsp;

  
**Do you have a BGG profile you'd like to share?**

If BGG happens to be up -  [angelkurisu on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/angelkurisu)

&amp;nbsp;

#**Favorites**

Preface: Excluding my own stuff (designed or published) because that’d be silly.


**What is your favorite game and why?**

This changes so often, given the nature of how many games we play. Recently, Root and Spirit Island are awesome, I wish I could play more Star Wars: Rebellion and Twilight Struggle, and given a good crowd, I’m always up for a game of Trade Empires...er...Sidereal Confluence.


**Who is your Favorite Designer and why?**

Vlaada’s got a pretty cool collection of varied games, and Knizia has done so many clever things over his tenure. 

**Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?**

So many are friends - Looney Labs, Gamelyn, GtG, Stronghold/IBC to name a few! 

**Favorite gaming mechanism?**

I love emergent mechanics in video games, which are really hard to do in a tabletop game as it turns out. Legacy games have come the closest to that. I like mechanics that’re clever, and that you have some control over. 


**Favorite gaming component?**

Cards. Always cool things to be done with cards!

**What game can you not stand or refuse to play?**

Betrayal (Sorry friends that worked on it!). I played the original version with the broken haunts, and it was one of my most negative gaming experiences ever. For whatever reason, it just doesn’t work for me - I have tried it again more recently, and nope.

&amp;nbsp;

#**Versus**

|Fight! | Winner!|  
| ---------:|:----------|

#**Q &amp; A**

**What does /r/boardgames mean to you?**

It’s a forum with often good discussions, something we need more of beyond BGG. It’s certainly much better than the discourse on the majority of reddit, but even here I’m often reminded of how far our fandom has yet to go in terms of growth. Diversity and inclusiveness are still “controversial”, which is kind of silly. That being said, the moderators here do a pretty reasonable job of keeping things in line, so thanks for that!



**What’s the most memorable gaming experience you’ve had?**

There’re so many! I’ve had an uncountable number of experiences at conventions and elsewhere playing games (both our creations and others) with people I’ve known for years, people I’ve just met, famous people, kinda-famous people...BGGCon especially is good for that. 

Now, if you want to hear about the most *absurd* gaming experience, it was a game of Dune that concluded with the Bene Gesserit revealing they’d guessed exactly who would win, on exactly what turn, and thus claiming victory for themselves instead. It was the only game of Dune I ever played, and it’s the only game of Dune I ever need to play. It was perfect.

**Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?**

I do, sometimes. I used to do it more, but the BGG rating system’s feels frustratingly broken due to bad-faith voters (see: I backed a game on KS! Instantly a 10! / I playtested the early version of this and didn’t like it: 2/10). It looks like I’ve got about a dozen 10s on BGG now, and I considered a 10 to be a game I’d always want to play. I tend not to revise ratings - if I rated something a 10 in 2006, it means I felt it was a 10 in 2006.


**Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?**

I hate those terms so much, haha. They’re useless now, and served only to provide a utterly needless divide/rivalry in board gaming 10-15 years ago. I like games, and if a game is fun, that’s what I care about. Randomness is fine, as long as it’s in the right quantity. I don’t want a 3 hour game whose arc is usurped by a pile of dice at the very end.

 

**How many games are in your collection? Are you satisfied with that number?**

I think we’ve got a couple hundred games here, which is probably too many, but also too few.


**If you could only keep 10 games in your collection, what 10 would they be?**  

- Gloomhaven  
- Innovation  
- Sidereal Confluence  
- SW: Rebellion  
- Dominion  
- Codenames  
- Spirit Island  
- Pyramid Arcade  
- Through the Ages  
- Kingdomino

This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;

Last December, a childhood friend of mine asked if i'd be willing to dedicate an entire day to play a boardgame. This friend and I were both former **RISK** enthusiasts, over 20 years ago, and never really played any other board game since other than perhaps a brief **MtG** period in it's early days. Not even **Catan**, **Carcassonne** or **Ticket to Ride**.

After he was able to gather enough willing bodies, he went to our local game shop and asked for the most grandiose wargame possible, with player negociation and heavy strategic possibilities. He walked out of there with the newly released (at the time) **Twilight Imperium 4.**

None of us had even heard of Twilight Imperium before that day. 14 hours later I was heading back home, head filled with new perspectives and ideas on how to play the game next time, which we had already scheduled for two weeks later. My mind was still so stimulated that I couldn't sleep at all that night, and instead just watched video reviews of TI:4 and discovered BGG and it's forums. I was completely hooked...

Over the next couple of months, I would slowly ease my wife and kids (10-13 y.o.) into the hobby with diversified and simple fun games, which transpires rather strongly in my collection. This was enlightening for our family, as it offered an interesting and somewhat inexpensive outlet away from our mobiles &amp; video games. My wife and I would often spend entire evenings playing many different 2-player games.

Fast-forward to today, I am at 437 logged plays according to my BGG account. This is my first COMC/shelfie post ever, which comes with the realization that I need a Kallax (or any decent unit really) pretty badly.

[https://imgur.com/qTZTz2d](https://imgur.com/qTZTz2d)

The games have completely taken over my TV unit, which tapped into submission a long time ago. The TV still lies inactive behind the top ""shelf"" of games.

&amp;#x200B;

*“How long have you been involved in the hobby?”*

 9 months.

&amp;#x200B;

*“What would you change about your collection if you could?”* 

Besides better storage, I wish I had kept the receipts of all the games I bought new inside their box, if only for future reference. However the more I think about it, the less I think I really want to know how much I actually spent...  I'd love to get a dedicated board game table eventually.

&amp;#x200B;

*“What is the newest game in the collection?”* 

I just received **Yellow &amp; Yangtze** and **Raptor** today!

&amp;#x200B;

*“Most played games // highest count of plays?”* 

**Jaipur**, **Biblios** and **Fox in the Forest**.

&amp;#x200B;

*“Any unplayed games/wall of shame?”* 

Excluding **Raptor** and **Yellow &amp; Yangtze**, I have yet to play **Tortuga 1667** (waiting for an uneven number of players of 7 or 9), **Telestrations** (received earlier this week) and **The Grizzled**.

&amp;#x200B;

*“What is your favorite games from your collection?""* 

Very hard to even come up with a single one, as I love most of them for very different reasons. But if I really had to, I'd say **La Cosa Nostra**. My gaming group just LOVES negotiation games. Combining their easy-going nature with a mobster-theme and a tendency to roleplay, this has been the best 20$ CAD invested in buying an unopened Kickstarter edition of this somewhat-uncommon game. This replaced **Sons Of Anarchy** for us, which I would strongly recommend to any fun groups looking for a cheap, simple and fun negotiation game. As with most social and/or negotiation game, these are heavily group dependent.

&amp;#x200B;

*“Prized possession?""* 

I recently sold a good/acceptable condition copy of 1979 **Dune**, by Avalon Hill. I didn't have the audacity to play with such a vintage copy, and the money I got for it was enough to purchase 4-5 new games I had on my wishlist.   Recently pledged my first Kickstarter for a copy of **Binding of Isaac: The Four Souls,** as I am a huge fan for Edmund McMillen and it video games design.

&amp;#x200B;

*“Which game are you thinking of selling next?""* 

I've actively been buying and selling games within my local scene, with 16 games sold since I started collecting. I'm thinking about maybe selling Quadropolis, since Welcome To scratches a similar itch, but has a much smaller footprint.

&amp;#x200B;

Please feel free to comment and recommend games that you think I'd like, or any types of suggestions/questions.

He walked out of there with the newly released (at the time) &lt;strong&gt;Twilight Imperium 4.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;None of us had even heard of Twilight Imperium before that day. 14 hours later I was heading back home, head filled with new perspectives and ideas on how to play the game next time, which we had already scheduled for two weeks later. My mind was still so stimulated that I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep at all that night, and instead just watched video reviews of TI:4 and discovered BGG and it&amp;#39;s forums. I was completely hooked...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the next couple of months, I would slowly ease my wife and kids (10-13 y.o.) into the hobby with diversified and simple fun games, which transpires rather strongly in my collection. This was enlightening for our family, as it offered an interesting and somewhat inexpensive outlet away from our mobiles &amp;amp; video games. My wife and I would often spend entire evenings playing many different 2-player games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fast-forward to today, I am at 437 logged plays according to my BGG account. This is my first COMC/shelfie post ever, which comes with the realization that I need a Kallax (or any decent unit really) pretty badly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/qTZTz2d""&gt;https://imgur.com/qTZTz2d&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The games have completely taken over my TV unit, which tapped into submission a long time ago. The TV still lies inactive behind the top &amp;quot;shelf&amp;quot; of games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“How long have you been involved in the hobby?”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;9 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What would you change about your collection if you could?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides better storage, I wish I had kept the receipts of all the games I bought new inside their box, if only for future reference. However the more I think about it, the less I think I really want to know how much I actually spent...  I&amp;#39;d love to get a dedicated board game table eventually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What is the newest game in the collection?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just received &lt;strong&gt;Yellow &amp;amp; Yangtze&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Raptor&lt;/strong&gt; today!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Most played games // highest count of plays?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Jaipur&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Biblios&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Fox in the Forest&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Any unplayed games/wall of shame?”&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Excluding &lt;strong&gt;Raptor&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Yellow &amp;amp; Yangtze&lt;/strong&gt;, I have yet to play &lt;strong&gt;Tortuga 1667&lt;/strong&gt; (waiting for an uneven number of players of 7 or 9), &lt;strong&gt;Telestrations&lt;/strong&gt; (received earlier this week) and &lt;strong&gt;The Grizzled&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“What is your favorite games from your collection?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very hard to even come up with a single one, as I love most of them for very different reasons. But if I really had to, I&amp;#39;d say &lt;strong&gt;La Cosa Nostra&lt;/strong&gt;. My gaming group just LOVES negotiation games. Combining their easy-going nature with a mobster-theme and a tendency to roleplay, this has been the best 20$ CAD invested in buying an unopened Kickstarter edition of this somewhat-uncommon game. This replaced &lt;strong&gt;Sons Of Anarchy&lt;/strong&gt; for us, which I would strongly recommend to any fun groups looking for a cheap, simple and fun negotiation game. As with most social and/or negotiation game, these are heavily group dependent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Prized possession?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently sold a good/acceptable condition copy of 1979 &lt;strong&gt;Dune&lt;/strong&gt;, by Avalon Hill. I didn&amp;#39;t have the audacity to play with such a vintage copy, and the money I got for it was enough to purchase 4-5 new games I had on my wishlist.   Recently pledged my first Kickstarter for a copy of &lt;strong&gt;Binding of Isaac: The Four Souls,&lt;/strong&gt; as I am a huge fan for Edmund McMillen and it video games design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;“Which game are you thinking of selling next?&amp;quot;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actively been buying and selling games within my local scene, with 16 games sold since I started collecting. I&amp;#39;m thinking about maybe selling Quadropolis, since Welcome To scratches a similar itch, but has a much smaller footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please feel free to comment and recommend games that you think I&amp;#39;d like, or any types of suggestions/questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have a great day!&lt;/p&gt;

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of **[CoolStuffInc](https://www.coolstuffinc.com/)**, the go-to online FLGS for many board gamers around the world. 

CoolStuff was very excited to give back to the /r/boardgames community, offering up the following great prizes:

* A copy of **Twilight Struggle: Collector's Edition** (this is the version that comes in a wood box and is very hard to find -- not even sure where CSI had it tucked away)
* 2 $100 gift cards, redeemable online

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What is your earliest gaming memory?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship WORLDWIDE. CSI gift cards can be redeemed online for worldwide shipping.

##The fine print

Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

## Race for the Galaxy version available on Amazon now

📷

1. This game has been out of stock for awhile now.
2. There is a second edition coming out very, very soon. I've read that it is out in Germany.
3. The game is now in stock on Amazon for $34.99 here:  [https://www.amazon.com/Rio-Grande-Games-RGG301-Galaxy/dp/B000YLAOEW/ref=sr\_1\_1\_m?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537063146&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=race+for+the+galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Rio-Grande-Games-RGG301-Galaxy/dp/B000YLAOEW/ref=sr_1_1_m?s=toys-and-games&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1537063146&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=race+for+the+galaxy)

I'm wondering if anyone knows if this is the new edition. There is nothing that says that it is. The box art on the official site is the same as the first but has a ""2nd Edition"" tag on it. The version for sale is the same page that has been selling for the past few years. I've not been able to find any additional information about the exact product.

Thanks for any help","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Race for the Galaxy version available on Amazon now&lt;/h2&gt;

Engine building, cute yet beautiful artwork, worker placement and special powers from cards, all of it sounded magical. I finally got the opportunity to play it last night, and here's my quick thoughts on it.

To clarify, this is of course a 1 play review. Take my opinions with the biggest grain of salt you can find.

**Components**

The artwork is, as stated earlier, gorgeous, and extremely evocative. All of the meeple in the game are adorable, and the resource tokens had a great tactile feel to them, especially the berries. I found the pebbles were a little hard to manipulate sometimes (I don't have the best fine motor skills) but overall **Everdell** hit it out of the park with components. 

The tree was a great gimmick and really added to the game's board presence. However, it did tend to obstruct the view of certain objectives depending on where you were seated. Additionally, workers continually fell off the top of the tree, which made the novelty wear a little.

**Gameplay**

I found the gameplay overall to be solid. Specifically:

1. The interactions provided by cards are the driving force of the game, and it was a lot of fun to see and learn about all the possible combinations. The early turns were marked with lots of excitement as new cards flipped up and our engines got going. 
2. The variability of the setup (different forest tiles, different special events/objectives) seems like a great way to vary the feeling of the game overall (though you'll see replayability being addressed in my negatives section below).
3. Card powers were relatively simple to understand, and there were some opportunities for me to feel clever as I combined various abilities in the game to maximise my points. 

HOWEVER, there were aspects of **Everdell** that didn't quite work for me. 

1. The worker placement didn't feel as tight as other games. There were times where someone would be on a space I wanted to take, but in such cases I'd simply just wait them out and jump on it once they moved off by preparing for the next season. This may have been because I simply had plenty of things I was able to do, meaning I had the ability to stall out, but it never felt like someone had snapped up the spot I wanted and I had to adjust (though another player did feel this at least once).
2. While the engines do work differently, I felt as though there wasn't really anything that made what I was doing particularly unique. Although our engines varied in effectiveness, they all seemed to amount to the same end: play more cards. I think the next point summarises this best.
3. Although there are many different cards in the game, ultimately they feel relatively similar (with some exceptions), to the point where I think future games will feel mostly similar as well. There were no particularly splashy cards that felt very exciting to play. Unique buildings didn't quite have as great a feel when I realised that other players could build them too. I think this is the biggest issue I had with the game; while the gameplay itself is smooth, easy-to-understand, and the combos between cards are there, **there's nothing that really sets me apart from other players, and there didn't seem to be much that would result in my future games feeling particularly unique.** Part of what contributes to this problem, I believe, is the building chain mechanism, which encourages you to partner the same cards together over and over. Although this is more important for some pairs than others, I felt it limited creativity. That's not to say there weren't creative plays to be had, but they were far fewer in number than what felt like more scripted plays.

Obviously, a one game experience may not end up being enough, and perhaps future plays will prove me wrong. I was almost certain I'd be backing the second print-run on Kickstarter for this, but I'm much more hesitant now. 

&amp;#x200B;

To be clear, I think **Everdell** is a good game, and I can understand why people enjoy it. I enjoyed my play of it as well; I'm just not sure it's the kind of game that would really hold up to repeated plays.

The general consensus in the board gaming community is that the Golem Edition theme and artwork are preferred to the spice theme. There are some who prefer spices, but they seem to be in the minority.

I am one of those, but for a reason I haven't seen.

Century Spice Road is well known as a game that distills resource conversion down to it's essence. This is part of what people both love and dislike about the game. You often hear ""trading cubes for cubes""as a descriptor for Century and it is one that's pretty accurate.

I was playing the game with my wife and the thought came to me, ""It's almost as if they made the game as a commentary on resource management.""

The more I thought about it, the more this seemed to make sense. The game feels like a satire on the entire genre, or as if Emerson Matsuchi played a heavy Euro and thought,""I can give people this experience with a tenth of the rules and in a fourth of the time.""

When viewed this way, the theme of trading/harvesting feels like the only possible one it could have.

I'm curious what people think. I know it was likely done for appealing to a wider audience, but it makes me smile a bit viewing it this way.

With some of the haunts being insanely hard without extra information (voodoo being the one that started this) my players started making notes for the secrets of survival tomb.

The only rules I had for the notes were they couldn't outright give away major information unless it was almost impossible to win without it. With voodoo we listed each pair of rooms but not the dolls associated with them or the hints.


This particular one in the image was just funny. 

So what happened during the game I acquired the musicbox which whenever a monster or explorer enters or starts their turn on the same space as me, they make a +4 sanity roll. If they fail they are mezed. The 1st time a mannequin tried to attack me I found out they only have 1 sanity and can not roll a 4. So at point I grabbed the mystic elevator and took my bell and spirit board and started taunting the mannequins to the elevator and had a good old fashion elevator rave party, I ended the game after I had loaded all 20 mannequins in my elevator then took them to the exit and escorted them out, it was a lovely party... until one of my teammates decided to drink bleach &lt;.&lt;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/GD5Zj0r.jpg""&gt;https://i.imgur.com/GD5Zj0r.jpg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I figured this is the fault of the carrier, so I reached out to them first. They need a package description to move forward. I reach out to GTG via the email provided in the order confirmation email for customer support (same as on their website).

I'm posting here hoping someone has an idea for contact info haven't thought of or in hopes that they have someone on Reddit who will reach out.

&lt;p&gt;I would like to hear yours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but starting with mine, I just met that girl and on her third dates  I invited her to play 6pl. game of thrones with friends as she told me she loves tabletop games.
 she manages to make a realky nice army and start to go for offense, I managed to convince her to attack my best friends saying that I will bring my support the stack rised up pretty high to the point that my support can flinch the combat on one or the other sides... when all the things was set I decided to shift the support towards my best friend... which makes both of them lost a ton in the game and allow me to set foot on easy territory for the rest of the game.
Things got pretty tensed.
Since that day she never want to play games with me but we ended up marrying anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

The sub was created relatively early on in the site's existence, even before the great migration from Digg a couple of years later. The first available [web archive capture](https://web.archive.org/web/20090801004439/https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/) of the /r/boardgames homepage shows that 10 months after creation, 58 people had subscribed. Remarkably, not a single post on the front page at that time was discussing Gloomhaven. Those were dark times, to be sure.

Obviously, the subscriber count went up as Reddit as a whole continued to grow -- by Sept. 2013, five years after the sub was created, the subscriber count had grown to about 45,000 (and still no Gloomhaven). Three years later, in 2016, it was up to 150,000. The growing popularity of hobby board gaming has lined up serendipitously with the continued growth of Reddit, propelling the subreddit to where it is today.

To mark this momentous occasion, we've lined up **a series of giveaways**, 10 days chock-full of prizes, the first of which will kick off tomorrow. Meanwhile, /u/erthule has been hard at work getting some high-profile folks together for **a special series of Meeple of the Week posts**.

Collection after recent room switch: [https://imgur.com/a/HcBTh2C](https://imgur.com/a/HcBTh2C)

I don't really know how to define how long I've been ""in"" the hobby, but I bought Carcassonne as a gift for my then girlfriend, later-that-day fiancee, and now wife a little over 10 years ago. I'd played the usual run of games as a kid and teenager (e.g. Monopoly, Risk, various games with poker cards, etc.), with Axis and Allies being the most complicated thing I tried before college. Like many in the hobby, Settlers was a springboard into ""German-style"" games while I was in college, and I've bought and acquired games fairly steadily since then.

I've donated, sold, or given away a couple dozen games over the last year or so, and I don't have anything major I'd change at this point. There are always games I'd like to try, but I already have more than I play regularly, so there's no rush to get anything at the moment.

The two images linked above show just about everything other than **Pitchcar**, a few small card games, and our kids games. I've played every game you see other than **Stronghold** and **Hyperborea**, which are two of my most recent purchases. My ""favorite"" games vary based on the people I play with, but I'll never say no to **Xia, Deus, Concordia, Stellar Conflict, Gloomhaven, Concept,** or **Bohnanza.**

I'll try to answer any questions, even rhetorical ones. It's a bad habit of mine.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Repost from yesterday after following posting rules more carefully...&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

To mark the occasion we'll be having a series of special Meeple of the Week posts in the coming week. Today we're warming up with a bit of a retrospective as we take a look at the first two ever featured Meeples of the Week: [GlugGlugBurp - the original entry!](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ri3ho/starting_today_we_will_be_having_a_rboardgames/) and [mrquinns](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/rsjyt/this_weeks_meeple_of_the_week_mrquinns_yeah_that/). Their posts are both reposted in full here, so let's have a look at what games were the hotness in 2012! 

Unlike in the regular posts, there is no expectation that they'll be around to answer questions in the comments, so here's a couple of discussion questions instead:

- Looking over the two lists below, do you think any of the games have been replaced by ""strictly"" better games since then?
- Did you play modern boardgames back in 2012? Which games from back then still see regular/occasional play with you or your group? Which have deservedly or unfairly been forgotten?


Thanks for reading and I hope to see you all in the comments below for a good discussion! 


Edit: title should naturally have read: ""A look to the past""

***
It's my pleasure to introduce the first spotlight r/boardgames user of the week!  **u/GlugGlugBurp** came up with this idea, and is active around this sub.  Congrats on being selected as the first ever weekly spotlight, and begin thinking about who you would like to nominate for next week.


**GlugGlugBurp's Hot Ten:**


1.  Descent 2nd ed - I own the first edition, but not Road to Legend, so i'll be interested in the conversion kit and whatever campaign play the new edition offers.

2.  Battlestar Galactica - this is probably THE best 5 player game out there now. this is the type of game that gamers should play in public to get people into the hobby. the experience is unlike any other.

3.  Galaxy Trucker - own it, but haven't played it very much. this is the type of game that just makes me happy playing it. not a brain burner, fun for most people, and pew pew! lasers! space pirates! asteroids! cargo holds!
4.  Ascending Empires - own it, but haven't played it very much. i dig the civ building and the flicking ( i changed the wooden peg ships to glass beads and the game seems to work great )

5.  Lords of Waterdeep - can't wait to try this, cube pushing, hidden goals, D&amp;D city atmosphere, seems like it will be fun.

6.  Venture Forth - i own this, but haven't played it very much. this is the closest thing to a gateway cube pusher that i've seen so far (unless someone has a better one that i haven't thought of. if so, please let me know!)

7.  7 Wonders - I own it and played it a few times, still not understanding how to see an over all strategy, but it's wicked fun with many people!

8.  Castle Panic: Wizards Tower - played it once, wanna play it more. the combos we saw from that one play with the wizards tower were amazing and i want to see if it was a fluke, or if there is more to offer there.

9.  Defenders of the Realm - played it once. awesome, awesome game, can't wait to play it again. but did they have to use the word 'taint'?

10.  Belfort - never played, want to see if this is another good cube pushing gateway to show to my friends and family. looks like it might be.

Welcome to the next entry of **Meeple of the Week**.  Last week, GlugGlugBurp was named MotW, and was given the opportunity to choose his successor.  He chose someone that many of you know, and this is going to be an exciting entry.  It is my pleasure to announce that this weeks' r/Boardgames Meeple of the Week is.....

**u/MrQuinns**. Yes, Quinns, from [Shut up and Sit Down](http://www.shutupshow.com/).  If you somehow haven't read the reviews or watched the episodes on that site, drop everything and make that a priority. 


GlugGlugBurp is a huge fan of the show, and Quinns.  He introduces this weeks MotW with:  ""mrquinns is approximately 50% of the hosts that appear during an average episode of the hit web series Shut up &amp; Sit down. I thought about trying to poke him with a pointy stick to see if he'd tell me what games were on his radar, but airfare was too expensive. so instead i messaged him through reddit and he said 'leave me alone!', which we all know in internet speak means 'yes.' Now, does anyone know what section of ebay would be best to list this pointy stick?""

Now, on MrQuinns.  Go ahead and leave questions and comments, he has made a point to check in on this at multiple points today and leave feedback and talk about whatever.  Here is his entry and Top Ten:



HELLOOO LADIES~

My name’s Quinns, I am one half of board game site &amp; review show [Shut Up &amp; Sit Down](http://www.shutupshow.com/) (the tall, difficult-to-please half) and I am super jazzed to have been nominated as Meeple of the Week!

My story is that I’m a video game journalist who’s drifted more and more into this hobby as he’s become more and more jaded towards video games. Board games, by contrast, seem like this gloriously rich seam of ideas, surprises and passion. So! My Top Ten is a mix of stuff I’ve adored forever and stuff I’m playing the hell out of right now. Like...


[Catacombs!](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/57390/catacombs) We’ll be giving this a sterling review on SU&amp;SD real soon, but it’s a dexterity game meets Dungeons &amp; Dragons. You probably need it. Defining moments include flicking your barbarian at a huge manticore only to fall an inch short (cue your entire team to erupt in horrified moans), only for the elf to bounce an arrow token /off a pillar/ to kill it anyway (cue entire team screaming with joy). Glorious, idiotic fun. Course, if you prefer your dungeoneeing serious, there’s always...

[Descent: Journeys Into the Dark](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17226/descent-journeys-in-the-dark). I have a repulsive fetish for board game that do their best to experiment with precisely how grand a board game can be, so in 2010 I fell for Descent hard. My friends and I spent two months getting about half way through a Road to Legend campaign before we admitted the heroes had won, but it remains the most played game in my collection. With the exception of...

[RoboRally (Wizards of the Coast edition)](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally). This alone got me into board games. That defining moment of terror where you realise you’ve sent your robot waddling happily into a crusher or flamethrower just kept me coming back for more, and when I chose to break out my old copy last year myself and five friends laughed more than with any other game that year. A classic. I haven’t played the new, Avalon Hill version but the barren look of it scares the piss out of me. Much like...

[Fury of Dracula (Fantasy Flight edition)](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20963/fury-of-dracula). For my money, /the/ asymmetrical game and /the/ hidden movement game. I still remember my first game of it, where I was dracula and decided to pounce on a lone hunter at night, thinking I could take ‘em. Protip: Don’t do that. The real magic here, on reflection, is it manages to make everyone feel empowered. The predators get to feel like part of a superteam, the prey feels like a mythical abomination. Speaking of superteams...

[Memoir ‘44: Overlord](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/37911/memoir-44-operation-overlord). Have you played this? Oh shit. You need to play it. Much like...

[Pictomania](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania). So I appreciate that Draw Something has exploded on smartphones recently, and that’s cool, but what’s even more fun is Vlaada Cvatil’s Pictomania which myself and Paul were screaming about &lt; link http://www.shutupshow.com/post/14115929161/review-pictomania &gt; last Chrismas. I get that we’re all hardcore boardgamers here, but you know what? You’d be a hardcore /idiot/ to turn your nose up at this one. That’s a fact, Jack. And so long as I’m espousing Mr. Chvatil’s work..

[Space Alert!](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert) My co-host on Shut Up &amp; Sit Down has a term for games like this, which is that he loves them because “he had no idea this was something a board game could be.” Space Alert, if you’re not aware, is a co-op game where you crew a space ship in real time against a series of horrible threats that are reeled off by a CD that comes with the game. It’s both the most obvious showcase of genius and the most tense game I’ve ever encountered. Speaking of space...

[Shadow Hunters](http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/24068/shadow-hunters). I was going to end with The Resistance, but I know you guys already know and love it so I figured I’d throw a curve ball instead. Shadow Hunters is another hidden roles game, Japanese this time (translated edition by Z-Man games), and it’s quite the thing.

The last time I played The Resistance it was with a full 10 people and it took almost two hours. Shadow Hunters is balm on that particular wound.

Man. I wrote a lot. Are you still reading? Christ! You’re insatiable! And I got nothing left.

[Past Meeples of the Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/meeple_of_the_week)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today marks the 10 year anniversary of &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;! To mark the occasion we&amp;#39;ll be having a series of special Meeple of the Week posts in the coming week. Today we&amp;#39;re warming up with a bit of a retrospective as we take a look at the first two ever featured Meeples of the Week: &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/ri3ho/starting_today_we_will_be_having_a_rboardgames/""&gt;GlugGlugBurp - the original entry!&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/rsjyt/this_weeks_meeple_of_the_week_mrquinns_yeah_that/""&gt;mrquinns&lt;/a&gt;. Their posts are both reposted in full here, so let&amp;#39;s have a look at what games were the hotness in 2012! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike in the regular posts, there is no expectation that they&amp;#39;ll be around to answer questions in the comments, so here&amp;#39;s a couple of discussion questions instead:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Looking over the two lists below, do you think any of the games have been replaced by &amp;quot;strictly&amp;quot; better games since then?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Did you play modern boardgames back in 2012? Which games from back then still see regular/occasional play with you or your group? Which have deservedly or unfairly been forgotten?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading and I hope to see you all in the comments below for a good discussion! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: title should naturally have read: &amp;quot;A look to the past&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s my pleasure to introduce the first spotlight &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; user of the week!  &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/GlugGlugBurp""&gt;u/GlugGlugBurp&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; came up with this idea, and is active around this sub.  Congrats on being selected as the first ever weekly spotlight, and begin thinking about who you would like to nominate for next week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GlugGlugBurp&amp;#39;s Hot Ten:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Descent 2nd ed - I own the first edition, but not Road to Legend, so i&amp;#39;ll be interested in the conversion kit and whatever campaign play the new edition offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Battlestar Galactica - this is probably THE best 5 player game out there now. this is the type of game that gamers should play in public to get people into the hobby. the experience is unlike any other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galaxy Trucker - own it, but haven&amp;#39;t played it very much. this is the type of game that just makes me happy playing it. not a brain burner, fun for most people, and pew pew! lasers! space pirates! asteroids! cargo holds!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ascending Empires - own it, but haven&amp;#39;t played it very much. i dig the civ building and the flicking ( i changed the wooden peg ships to glass beads and the game seems to work great )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lords of Waterdeep - can&amp;#39;t wait to try this, cube pushing, hidden goals, D&amp;amp;D city atmosphere, seems like it will be fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Venture Forth - i own this, but haven&amp;#39;t played it very much. this is the closest thing to a gateway cube pusher that i&amp;#39;ve seen so far (unless someone has a better one that i haven&amp;#39;t thought of. if so, please let me know!)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;7 Wonders - I own it and played it a few times, still not understanding how to see an over all strategy, but it&amp;#39;s wicked fun with many people!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Castle Panic: Wizards Tower - played it once, wanna play it more. the combos we saw from that one play with the wizards tower were amazing and i want to see if it was a fluke, or if there is more to offer there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Defenders of the Realm - played it once. awesome, awesome game, can&amp;#39;t wait to play it again. but did they have to use the word &amp;#39;taint&amp;#39;?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Belfort - never played, want to see if this is another good cube pushing gateway to show to my friends and family. looks like it might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Welcome to the next entry of &lt;strong&gt;Meeple of the Week&lt;/strong&gt;.  Last week, GlugGlugBurp was named MotW, and was given the opportunity to choose his successor.  He chose someone that many of you know, and this is going to be an exciting entry.  It is my pleasure to announce that this weeks&amp;#39; &lt;a href=""/r/Boardgames""&gt;r/Boardgames&lt;/a&gt; Meeple of the Week is.....&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/MrQuinns""&gt;u/MrQuinns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Yes, Quinns, from &lt;a href=""http://www.shutupshow.com/""&gt;Shut up and Sit Down&lt;/a&gt;.  If you somehow haven&amp;#39;t read the reviews or watched the episodes on that site, drop everything and make that a priority. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GlugGlugBurp is a huge fan of the show, and Quinns.  He introduces this weeks MotW with:  &amp;quot;mrquinns is approximately 50% of the hosts that appear during an average episode of the hit web series Shut up &amp;amp; Sit down. I thought about trying to poke him with a pointy stick to see if he&amp;#39;d tell me what games were on his radar, but airfare was too expensive. so instead i messaged him through reddit and he said &amp;#39;leave me alone!&amp;#39;, which we all know in internet speak means &amp;#39;yes.&amp;#39; Now, does anyone know what section of ebay would be best to list this pointy stick?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, on MrQuinns.  Go ahead and leave questions and comments, he has made a point to check in on this at multiple points today and leave feedback and talk about whatever.  Here is his entry and Top Ten:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELLOOO LADIES~&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My name’s Quinns, I am one half of board game site &amp;amp; review show &lt;a href=""http://www.shutupshow.com/""&gt;Shut Up &amp;amp; Sit Down&lt;/a&gt; (the tall, difficult-to-please half) and I am super jazzed to have been nominated as Meeple of the Week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My story is that I’m a video game journalist who’s drifted more and more into this hobby as he’s become more and more jaded towards video games. Board games, by contrast, seem like this gloriously rich seam of ideas, surprises and passion. So! My Top Ten is a mix of stuff I’ve adored forever and stuff I’m playing the hell out of right now. Like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/57390/catacombs""&gt;Catacombs!&lt;/a&gt; We’ll be giving this a sterling review on SU&amp;amp;SD real soon, but it’s a dexterity game meets Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons. You probably need it. Defining moments include flicking your barbarian at a huge manticore only to fall an inch short (cue your entire team to erupt in horrified moans), only for the elf to bounce an arrow token /off a pillar/ to kill it anyway (cue entire team screaming with joy). Glorious, idiotic fun. Course, if you prefer your dungeoneeing serious, there’s always...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/17226/descent-journeys-in-the-dark""&gt;Descent: Journeys Into the Dark&lt;/a&gt;. I have a repulsive fetish for board game that do their best to experiment with precisely how grand a board game can be, so in 2010 I fell for Descent hard. My friends and I spent two months getting about half way through a Road to Legend campaign before we admitted the heroes had won, but it remains the most played game in my collection. With the exception of...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/18/roborally""&gt;RoboRally (Wizards of the Coast edition)&lt;/a&gt;. This alone got me into board games. That defining moment of terror where you realise you’ve sent your robot waddling happily into a crusher or flamethrower just kept me coming back for more, and when I chose to break out my old copy last year myself and five friends laughed more than with any other game that year. A classic. I haven’t played the new, Avalon Hill version but the barren look of it scares the piss out of me. Much like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/20963/fury-of-dracula""&gt;Fury of Dracula (Fantasy Flight edition)&lt;/a&gt;. For my money, /the/ asymmetrical game and /the/ hidden movement game. I still remember my first game of it, where I was dracula and decided to pounce on a lone hunter at night, thinking I could take ‘em. Protip: Don’t do that. The real magic here, on reflection, is it manages to make everyone feel empowered. The predators get to feel like part of a superteam, the prey feels like a mythical abomination. Speaking of superteams...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/37911/memoir-44-operation-overlord""&gt;Memoir ‘44: Overlord&lt;/a&gt;. Have you played this? Oh shit. You need to play it. Much like...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/98229/pictomania""&gt;Pictomania&lt;/a&gt;. So I appreciate that Draw Something has exploded on smartphones recently, and that’s cool, but what’s even more fun is Vlaada Cvatil’s Pictomania which myself and Paul were screaming about &amp;lt; link &lt;a href=""http://www.shutupshow.com/post/14115929161/review-pictomania""&gt;http://www.shutupshow.com/post/14115929161/review-pictomania&lt;/a&gt; &amp;gt; last Chrismas. I get that we’re all hardcore boardgamers here, but you know what? You’d be a hardcore /idiot/ to turn your nose up at this one. That’s a fact, Jack. And so long as I’m espousing Mr. Chvatil’s work..&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert""&gt;Space Alert!&lt;/a&gt; My co-host on Shut Up &amp;amp; Sit Down has a term for games like this, which is that he loves them because “he had no idea this was something a board game could be.” Space Alert, if you’re not aware, is a co-op game where you crew a space ship in real time against a series of horrible threats that are reeled off by a CD that comes with the game. It’s both the most obvious showcase of genius and the most tense game I’ve ever encountered. Speaking of space...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/28143/race-for-the-galaxy""&gt;Race For the Galaxy&lt;/a&gt;, on the other hand, is the most guarded showcase of genius in my collection.

In my dream lifestyle, I’d host the Hollywood interpretation of a regularly scheduled poker night (complete with smoking, beers and discussions of women) except we’d play RftG instead. And, to finish off the sci-fi theme, there’s...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/12493/twilight-imperium-third-edition""&gt;Twilight Imperium 3rd edition&lt;/a&gt;. I own this game and both expansions, and I have played it precisely twice. That’s a cost of £65 per game. And I don’t feel ripped off in the slightest. I got much love for TI3. And finally...&lt;/p&gt;

Frédéric has no problem to give a lot details about his work, kickstarter, his business relationship, etc.. he's an open book. [http://laradiodesjeux.org/s07e04-frederic-henry/](http://laradiodesjeux.org/s07e04-frederic-henry/)

Concerning **Claustrophobia**, their next kickstarter with a different model (stock limited to 10k units already produced, no SG), he shared all the production costs. I found the details fascinating.

The costs for 1 Claustrophobia box, based on 10k units production :

* $5 for figurine molds
* $2.5 for sculpture
* $1.5 for illustrations
* $20 for salaries (Monolith uses internal employees to work on the ks)
* $26 for the print run (including $20 for the cardboard printing !)
* $1 for transport by ship
* $12 for VAT (it's an global average 15%)
* $6 for royalties (8% of final price to the author)
* $8 for ks (10%)

82$ production costs for a game that will be sold 79$.( it includes De Profundis content)

So it's not profitable... for the first print run. If the game is a success (the 10k boxes sold), they will be able to run a second kickstarter, and this time : the first 4 cost line disappear.

Mythic Battle : the second print run with $1,1M was way more profitable than the first one with $2,6M.

&amp;#x200B;

**Print run**

Once mold and scuplture are paid, figurines cost between $0.1 and $0.12 to produce. So with large print run, cardboard cost more than plastic. According to Frédéric, with only 25 tiles and twice more figurines, the game would be cheaper

**Royalties**

Interesting, Monolith wants to pay 2x the author compared to the other big ks compagnies(4% seems to be the norm), to attract the best authors in the long run.

**Why Claustrophobia**

Erwan, an other owner of Monolith is fan of Claustrophobia and they know very well the author Croc, the author. But Claustro was planned by FFG. Since they are all friends with Marc Nunès, co-founder of Asmodee, they used their influence to retrieve the game.

I don't remember seeing anyone posting close ups of graphics of the board and the playmat for comparisons so i thought of doing one...

i personally like the board's graphics as they're more sharp, but that's obviously a given since printing on a fabric/mat isn't the same as printing on a paperlike surface... the mat seems to have more vibrant colour tones than the board though...to each on their own obviously on which you prefer.

i hope the quality stays on high quality for posting on FB..i'm not sure if FB reduces picture quality or not when uploading albums.


**edit:** size comparisons of all 3. regular board, mat, extended board. (it's not my picutre, i took the url from FB Scythe group i'm in. let me know if it doesn't work for you)

It took me a few plays to crack this nut but I’ve finally been able to design a city or two that worked.

Sprawlopolis is the latest published offering from Button Shy Games, a wonderful wallet game that actually will fit in your pocket. Featuring variable win conditions with tons of combos so no two games are ever the same. Tight decision making, great graphic design, easy to learn. All that in 18 cards. It may actually take you longer to read this little review than it would to play a full game.

Button Shy's description: *In Sprawlopolis, 1-4 players work together to build a new city from the ground up. Using only 18 cards and a variable scoring system, the game is never the same twice. Each turn, players will play 1 card from their hand to the growing city, trying to score as many points as possible. Players will have to communicate and plan without revealing their own cards in order to most efficiently develop large areas in each of the 4 zone types. Watch out though, the city hates paying for road maintenance so each road will cost you points in the end. When all cards have been placed, the game ends and player see if they have met dynamically generated minimum score for their game. Can you meet the demands of the officials, work with your fellow planners and build the ultimate urban wonder? It’s time to find out!*

When I say tight decision making, I mean it. With 18 cards in a standard game, and only 15 of the comprising your city, every single card placement is meaningful.

To begin, the player shuffles all 18 cards, and then draws and flips over 3 of them to reveal the scoring objectives and the number of points needed to reach a win. You then place down the first card to start your city, draw a hand of 3 more cards and have just 14 more cards to (hopefully) meet or exceed the score you need.

Each card consists of 4 blocks of the 4 different colored zones. And also a few roads. After you draw your initial hand of 3, you place 1 card at a time, drawing it’s replacement from the deck before placing another card. Your objective is to place cards next to or overlapping each other so that you create a city tableau that matches your unique scoring requirements.

Every city will score base points for their largest contiguous grouping of each of the 4 different zones. Then you add up how many completed roads you’ve made and subtract that number from yoru score. Ouch! Check your unique objectives to see how many more points you can scrape up and then compare your final score to the total on the objectives.

It’s not anywhere near as easy as it sounds.  

I’ve played this game mostly solo and it’s one I very much enjoy. In 10 to 15 minutes I can get in a thinky, intense  little game session that’s got my brain buzzing, but isn’t long enough to actually have smoke coming out of me ears. It’s perfect for me when I want something relatively deep but don’t have the time or energy to invest an hour of brain power or more. As an added bonus, it takes about 10 seconds to set up a new game of Sprawlopolis!

The game features clear, concise graphic design and artwork – really the two are on here, and there’s not any ambiguity as to what’s on any particular card. It was designed by the same team that brought us Circle the Wagons. 

To be honest, I prefer this one as a solo game, though it can accommodate up to 4 players. In co-op mode it can create some interesting conversations around the game but depending on who you’re playing with, this 15 minute gem could drag on a bit longer than it should.

I mean really, this is just ridiculously fun.

The Legacy format means that the game balances itself, with the result that more time is spent at that absolutely delicious state of brinksmanship. 

Occasionally some of the changes are pretty bloody huge, and here's the thing, that you don't know when they're going to happen adds this basic level of tension. 

I'm at month 6 of 12, and the game right now is fresh. I'd be quite happy just to play it like this, but next game we're going to get hit with something new, and I'll be not just thinking ""this is fresh"" but almost overwhelmed with adapting to a the new situation, even really simple little additions feel signifiant, when you're only just winning or losing the games. 

Something else I noticed, my team-mate and I have got a system going on which feels almost exploitative, like we've found a combo-wombo that breaks the game, and when I posted here recently it seems a lot of other people also felt that way, but were doing things totally different to us. 

To be honest, I think I just want everyone who's able to, to experience this wonderful game.

&lt;p&gt;The Legacy format means that the game balances itself, with the result that more time is spent at that absolutely delicious state of brinksmanship. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Occasionally some of the changes are pretty bloody huge, and here&amp;#39;s the thing, that you don&amp;#39;t know when they&amp;#39;re going to happen adds this basic level of tension. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m at month 6 of 12, and the game right now is fresh. I&amp;#39;d be quite happy just to play it like this, but next game we&amp;#39;re going to get hit with something new, and I&amp;#39;ll be not just thinking &amp;quot;this is fresh&amp;quot; but almost overwhelmed with adapting to a the new situation, even really simple little additions feel signifiant, when you&amp;#39;re only just winning or losing the games. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something else I noticed, my team-mate and I have got a system going on which feels almost exploitative, like we&amp;#39;ve found a combo-wombo that breaks the game, and when I posted here recently it seems a lot of other people also felt that way, but were doing things totally different to us. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I think I just want everyone who&amp;#39;s able to, to experience this wonderful game. &lt;/p&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In Steam you build railroads and deliver goods along an ever changing network of tracks and stations. You build the tracks, upgrade towns, improve your train, and grab the right goods to make the longest, most profitable deliveries. Score your deliveries and add to your income or victory points, balancing your need to invest against your quest to win the game.

Steam contains a beautiful, double-sided game board. The map on each side depicts terrain, towns, and cities at the start of the railway age. The map of the northeastern USA and neighboring Canada is ideal for 3 or 4 players. Use the map of Europe's lower Rhine and Ruhr region when playing a 4 or 5 player game. You can play Steam on any number of current and future variant and expansion maps, so we include pieces for 6 players.

The game plays very similarly to Age of Steam but with modifications to some of its mechanics and artwork. Tracks for income, train level, etc. are all printed on the board around the map such that alternate maps can be overlaid on the board and the necessary tracks will still be able to be used.

Similar to:

     Railways of the World

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: A few people have asked about some specific examples so I'll put the ones I've seen here. (Keep in mind I've only been to 4 game nights with this group and she was there 3/4)

1. **Splendor:** Throughout the game she would buy things whenever she was 1 off of being able to successfully purchase the item.
2. **Photosynthesis:** She would constantly move her pieces off of the player board without paying for them and using them from the ""active pool"". She would also move her points track up an extra point or 2 every photosynthesis phase (or whatever it's called)
3. **Port Auctioning Game** (I can't remember the exact name of this one, but you had a limited number of ships and gold to bid on various ports for resources that you can trade in for cards): This is the one that hit the hardest since there aren't enough cards in the game for all 5 players (Actual game design mechanic, not missing pieces). She was close to the bank so she would take money from the bank during other players turns. She also would draw 2 cards from the top of the deck when she paid for 1 (no one else did this). Last, there are a total of 5 wild tokens in the game and the tokens can be drawn randomly from a bag that only gets refilled after it is depleted. We had all 5 tokens out on the board/bought by other players on the turn before hers. The player before her spends his 2 wilds which should go to the discard pile. She takes her turn and draws 4 random tiles from the bag and draws 1 of the resource she needs and TWO wilds (wonder where she got those).
4. **Concordia:** She would take some resources from the supply when she thought no one was looking.

Edit 2: She wasn’t there tonight, but that gave me a good chance to talk to one of the organizers of the event. He said that they mostly just let it slide. Apparently it’s easier to allow that then to have her lose a game. Anyways, I’ll probably be looking into other gaming groups since I don’t want my fun to be decided on their attendance.

Personally, I would love to see something breath new life into &lt;strong&gt;Lords of Waterdeep&lt;/strong&gt; and I think multi-colored (multi-class) cubes like paladins, monks, and warlocks would be great. &lt;/p&gt;

We are asking for nominations for **Game of the Week** (GOTW) for the next couple months.

[Game of the Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3AGotW) is our weekly feature on games that are still appealing two or more years after release. We discuss them over the next year or so after nomination, and then a few years later in our GOTW:Redux feature.

Please up-vote on all games in this thread that you think merit being featured in GOTW.

After reviewing the nominations made by others, please nominate great games. Post a top-level comment with a single game name.

Suggest games that are:

* Are not in [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/game_of_the_week#wiki_previous_games_of_the_week) of past GOTW.
* Are not [already scheduled](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/game_of_the_week#wiki_future_games_of_the_week) to be future GOTW
* Not already nominated by someone else

We remove comments that:

* Nominate multiple games at once
* Nominate expansions/rethemes (e.g. Ticket to Ride: Marklin)
* Nominate something already nominated

If you have comments or questions about game of the week that are not related to voting, please PM the moderators. Commentary and questions clog up the voting because of the way contest mode works.

You can nominate as many worthwhile games as you like.

&amp;#x200B;

The wife and I have played 1/2 a dozen games over the past 2 days and really believe this is the best Tiny Epic yet.

Lots of ways to play the game, though we've only done the 2p co op.

Set up is not to bad. Its time consuming (10 min) but not difficult. By the last game, tag-teaming, it was a breeze. Cleanup is also easy, just put the token in their bags.

&amp;#x200B;

Its also worth mentioning we do have the play mat.  It does make placing the cards a breeze.

&amp;#x200B;

What i really like is the non stop action. Very little down time.  The ""AI"" is a very quick turn.  Turn order is: p1-AI-p2-AI...etc

&amp;#x200B;

Also because the game is coop even during your partners turn you're still engaged.  It does leave a hole open for back seat gaming,, but for us personally, that's not an issue.

&amp;#x200B;

The replay ability so far seems great. After 6 games i feel Ive barley scratched the surface.  With the delux edition there are 18 characters, which also double as 18 zombie players. there are 9 objectives (3 chosen at random each game) and 8 2-sided location cards.  There is a ton of variety in the way each game plays.

&amp;#x200B;

Depending on the Zombie boss, the combo of players, the objectives, and the layout of the mall (the board) every game your goals and the way you achieve them change.

&amp;#x200B;

For the record we are 2/4.  Its not an easy game.  We won our first and last.

&amp;#x200B;

My few grips would just be the rng of all the setup. Some combos are just harder.  Some combos are eaiser.  Kind of like pandemic, not exactly, but the ""setup rng"" can affect the difficulty of the game.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Over all I really like it.  i can't wait to play again.  Tons of action, every game feels different, and tons of new characters and zombie bosses to check out.   I cant say it will hold up like gloomhaven, but i can see playing this game a ton.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

The 2+ player option look like a ton of fun too.  They dont change the game to drasticly either.  Its also the type of game where if 1 person knows the rules well, newbies can jump right in.

&amp;#x200B;

I'd be happy to answer any question about gameplay or setup or whatever.  Thanks for reading. :)

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The wife and I have played 1/2 a dozen games over the past 2 days and really believe this is the best Tiny Epic yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of ways to play the game, though we&amp;#39;ve only done the 2p co op.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set up is not to bad. Its time consuming (10 min) but not difficult. By the last game, tag-teaming, it was a breeze. Cleanup is also easy, just put the token in their bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Its also worth mentioning we do have the play mat.  It does make placing the cards a breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What i really like is the non stop action. Very little down time.  The &amp;quot;AI&amp;quot; is a very quick turn.  Turn order is: p1-AI-p2-AI...etc&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also because the game is coop even during your partners turn you&amp;#39;re still engaged.  It does leave a hole open for back seat gaming,, but for us personally, that&amp;#39;s not an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

Tl;dr: Why does duck and cover change the defcon status from a real world perspective?

A friend and I are trying to make sense of Twilight Struggle. Had it for years, but never could get enough games in to figure out if I really like it. Still trying to figure that out.

Any case, this post doesn't really have anything to do with that except that we are newbies and probably played this totally wrong strategically.

With that in mind, it was the headline of turn five. DEFCON is at three. I'm the USSR and headline ""We will bury you"" and he headlines ""Duck and cover"". Since WWBY is four operation points and D&amp;C is three operation points WWBY triggers first. He doesn't have UN intervention thus degrading DEFCON one level, now at DEFCON 2. 

D&amp;C goes next and degrades DEFCON one more level resulting in the end of the game and his loss.

All good here. But we tried to imagine the story. We could see how WWBY might degrade DEFCON a level, but not so much D&amp;C. Yes, a paranoid episode is U.S. history, but would that have resulted in a status change of DEFCON? Would the military really have cared?

We are To The Death! Games &amp; Pastimes, a couple of guys from Salem, OR making games. Two weeks ago we began the open beta for our game Mort-a-Mania, a 1920's undead, vegas style, fight-night, Battle Royale!

The feedback we have received already is incredible and has already had positive effects on the game. We take all feedback we receive very seriously and are beyond grateful for the support and help the community has thus far provided. 

The beta is still up and cooking and we would love to hear as many of your thoughts as possible! So please, head on over to our [website](https://www.tothedeathgames.com/) and give it a download for free.

Here is a little about the game:

It is designed for up to four players and takes about 20-30 minutes per play. All you will need to play the open beta will be plastic sleeves to fit the printed cards in (penny sleeves work fantastic), dry erase markers you can write on the cards with, and a dice that can be used for deciding random decisions.

The game focuses heavily on auction strategy and table politics.

As this is only a beta release, we are still mostly without game assets like card art. While we don’t plan on adding them to the beta, we will be posting some of the cooler ones on our website, so if you want to see some art, feel free to check it out. 

If you have any questions, concerns, comments, or just want to chat, feel free to comment away, send us a message, or email us directly tothedeathgames@gmail.com","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;First off, thank you for taking the time to give this post a read through. &lt;/p&gt;

1. **Number the players clockwise.** You're 0. The person to your left is 1. The person to their left is 2. etc.
2. **Players choose numbers.** On the count of three, everyone sticks out some amount of fingers into the middle of the table.
3. **Count the total** number of fingers.
4. **Divide and find the remainder:** Divide the **fingers** by the **number of players**. Find the remainder (i.e. whatever doesn't neatly divide to make a whole number).
5. **The remainder identifies who goes first.**

I love this because the whole thing takes about five seconds, it works with any player count under 10, and the players don't need to have any idea what's going on. Just point around the table to give everyone their identity (starting at zero!), then ask them to shove any number of fingers into the middle.

An example, if it helps:

*Alex is Player 0, Ivy (to his left) is Player 1, and Erica (to her left) is Player 2.*

*Alex puts out 1 finger. Ivy puts out 9. Erica, trying to be cheeky, puts out 0.*

&amp;#x200B;

Space Alert is my favorite boardgame. I checked the BGG forum, the first post started this month.

If you ever wanted to get the feeling of what it feels like to be on Star Trek during a battle, this is it.

It's a 1 - 5 player ( 4-5 player for best experience) real time survival game with programmatic movement and actions.  It's like RoboRally and Escape the hidden temple had a space baby.  

Players have to work in unison to negotiate the relentless assaults from a variety of space monsters and or invaders for 10 straight action packed minutes.  

After 10 minutes, you reset to board, and replay every action you did to see if you actually survived the threats and come out alive.

Your heart will be pumping at the end.  I don't get that from any other boardgame.

I like to play ""everyone is the captain"" where all players need to take 1 turn being the captain.  Sometimes it's more fun seeing everything collapse than coming out on top.  I have only won a small handful of games, but I enjoyed myself every time. 

And if you want to wrack your brain, you can try it solo, where you control all the players.  (It's really tough,but hella fun)

It's also one of the first games I bought about 6 years ago, now my collection over 100.  It also introduced me to Vlaada Chvatil games; Mage Knight and Civilization are on my top 10, with MK being my favorite solo game.

Go out and try/buy it.  I can't recommend it enough.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's some of my favorite memories:

&amp;#x200B;

Guy thought he was in lower blue, so he ended the game with 3 C's.  Turns out he was really in bottom white.  So instead of firing 3 rockets, he looks out the window 3 times.  He built into the narrative how tired he was, and how everyone else ""got this"" so he just put his feet up and watched as we jumped to safety (we of course exploded)

&amp;#x200B;

I had an argument with someone over priority, how he had to fire the laser or we're definitely dead, I told him we're only *probably* dead if he didn't, where we're definitely dead if he didn't disable the bomb.

&amp;#x200B;

On the first round, I forgot to remove an energy cube, and that cascaded through the mission.  For the rest of the games after that, I was blamed for all missing energy cubes, even if I was no where near it.

&amp;#x200B;

Someone took the 2nd pair of battlebots, I said ""I don't know, what if we get battle bot uprising"" They said ""what's the odds of that""  next internal threat, battlebot uprising. 

&amp;#x200B;

One of the newer players had to be Captain (after playing a few rounds).  They had a total breakdown.  We were asking what do we do, and they were just like ""I DON'T KNOW.  Can someone mutiny and take over for me?  I'll gladly go to the brig.""

&amp;#x200B;

Once I was captain, and there was absolutely no way we were going to make it, and we had less than a minute left so I just looked at everyone and said ""Gentlemen, it's been a privilege playing with you tonight.""  Then I started playing a pretend violin.  They asked me what I was doing, so I said ""the Titanic is sinking"" and they all started playing their own imaginary instruments until the mission was over.  (sound effects were added, of course)

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;p&gt;I like to play &amp;quot;everyone is the captain&amp;quot; where all players need to take 1 turn being the captain.  Sometimes it&amp;#39;s more fun seeing everything collapse than coming out on top.  I have only won a small handful of games, but I enjoyed myself every time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you want to wrack your brain, you can try it solo, where you control all the players.  (It&amp;#39;s really tough,but hella fun)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s also one of the first games I bought about 6 years ago, now my collection over 100.  It also introduced me to Vlaada Chvatil games; Mage Knight and Civilization are on my top 10, with MK being my favorite solo game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go out and try/buy it.  I can&amp;#39;t recommend it enough.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s some of my favorite memories:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guy thought he was in lower blue, so he ended the game with 3 C&amp;#39;s.  Turns out he was really in bottom white.  So instead of firing 3 rockets, he looks out the window 3 times.  He built into the narrative how tired he was, and how everyone else &amp;quot;got this&amp;quot; so he just put his feet up and watched as we jumped to safety (we of course exploded)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had an argument with someone over priority, how he had to fire the laser or we&amp;#39;re definitely dead, I told him we&amp;#39;re only &lt;em&gt;probably&lt;/em&gt; dead if he didn&amp;#39;t, where we&amp;#39;re definitely dead if he didn&amp;#39;t disable the bomb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the first round, I forgot to remove an energy cube, and that cascaded through the mission.  For the rest of the games after that, I was blamed for all missing energy cubes, even if I was no where near it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Someone took the 2nd pair of battlebots, I said &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know, what if we get battle bot uprising&amp;quot; They said &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the odds of that&amp;quot;  next internal threat, battlebot uprising. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the newer players had to be Captain (after playing a few rounds).  They had a total breakdown.  We were asking what do we do, and they were just like &amp;quot;I DON&amp;#39;T KNOW.  Can someone mutiny and take over for me?  I&amp;#39;ll gladly go to the brig.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I was captain, and there was absolutely no way we were going to make it, and we had less than a minute left so I just looked at everyone and said &amp;quot;Gentlemen, it&amp;#39;s been a privilege playing with you tonight.&amp;quot;  Then I started playing a pretend violin.  They asked me what I was doing, so I said &amp;quot;the Titanic is sinking&amp;quot; and they all started playing their own imaginary instruments until the mission was over.  (sound effects were added, of course)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

After three of these under my belt, I think I'm finally getting the hang of this format. Last week's post about Aeon's End sparked a lot of debate, and I'm very grateful for everyone sharing their opinions, especially their disagreements about replayability. It's always important to remember in discussion that opinions are never wrong. Sometimes we just view things through our own lenses, and that's alright. We don't have to agree, we just have to always try to discuss things civilly and respectfully. I wish we could take the civility found in board game discussion and apply it to other (perhaps more) important topics like politics.

Back to today's topic: Twilight Struggle. In Twilight Struggle, two players take on the role of the superpowers USA and USSR to reenact the decades-long Cold War. Published in 2005 by Ananda Gupta and Jason Matthews, Twilight Struggle is GMT's best-selling game of all time, selling well over 100,000 copies.

When I got into board gaming in 2011, Twilight Struggle ranked #1 on BGG and continued to reign for another four years, a stretch of dominance that may never be matched by another board game. So when I first bought and played TS, it was really out of curiosity to see what made the top game in the world so special. And now, as I post 10 things you should know before you buy this game, I'll try to leave bias out of it as much as possible, because it is my *opinion* that TS is one of the greatest games of all time. And, yes, I'm still raw that Pandemic Legacy Season 1 knocked it off its top spot.

**""Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are – but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...""
– John F. Kennedy**  

1. If you haven't played many card driven war games, **you need to be willing to play Twilight Struggle three times** before you can form a full opinion of the game. Your first play will be spent grasping the strategy and the principles of the game and the system. Your second play will be spent solidifying that understanding and getting to know the cards a little better. Your third play will determine whether or not you truly will like this game. If you're the type of person who only gives a game one chance to wow you, there's a good chance you may not be wowed. I like to compare it to The Wire. The Wire's first episode isn't going to blow you away, but give it the first season, and you'll see why it's the greatest TV show of all time.

2. **A typical game of TS runs about 2-3 hours long.** If you have trouble getting longer games to the table with your SO or game playing partner, this may not be a great fit for you.

3. **If you love games that are dripping with tension and tough choices, then you will love this game.** Many turns will be spent agonizing over which card to play when you don't want to play either card. Other turns you will need to contemplate the best order to play your hand, and then have to adjust when your opponent does something you didn't foresee.

4. **If you love games that have a lot going on, then you will love this game.** TS will not walk you through to the end. From the get go, the entire world is your oyster. You can attempt to spread your influence anywhere in the world, coup any country controlled by your opponent, and there are several good strategies for each side to pursue based on what cards they are dealt. You can't block your opponent everywhere. Do you sacrifice your cards for their one-time powerful events or discard them for operations points? Each action you must pick and choose which fronts to engage your opponent and where to cede ground in order to maximize your strategy in other parts of the world. It is a medium to medium heavy game (I'd agree with those who vote more toward medium).

5. **The better you know the cards in this game, the better your experience will be.** I recommend playing this with a friend who knows just as much about the game as you do, and you two learn it together. It puts you on equal footing. If an experienced player is teaching you the game, they aren't your friend if they aren't handicapping themselves to give you a fair shot at winning. If someone knows what cards are coming and you don't, it gives them an advantage that is hard to make up without a handicap.

6. **Twilight Struggle is not a *pure* strategy game.** There is a bit of luck involved. Sometimes your opponent will get a good draw of cards. But usually that means you have a good draw coming soon too. Sometimes the region that you don't want to get scored pops back up. Sometimes the dice don't roll your way. Most of the time, these things can be mitigated by smart play and wise choices, but not always. I can't think of too many games where after losing I thought it was solely because of chance that I lost. However, if you can't handle bad luck or chance swaying your game in any way, then this might not be the game for you.

7. As mentioned, Twilight Struggle is a reenactment of the Cold War. **The game does a wonderful job of immersing you into the era through the events, card artwork, and game play.** You don't have to love the Cold War to love the game, but an interest in history, politics, and the machinations of global superpowers doesn't hurt.

8. **The components are not going to blow you away.** There is nothing wrong with them, but these are your standard fare GMT components. They get the job done. A collector's edition was released for Twilight Struggle, but it was more of an exercise in teaching GMT to never do one again than a representation of what a collector's edition ought to be. No one was really satisfied with the outcome after seeing what ""Collector's Edition"" meant for games like Small World, War of the Ring, and Takenoko.

9. **The replayability is found in the cards.** Every game will be unique because you will have a different hand and different choices to make. Your opponent will too. If you know Middle East is going to score in the first round because you hold the card, your strategy becomes starkly different than if you don't have it. You also know that by holding it in round 1, you may end up scoring it again in round 3, so it is vitally important to build up your influence in the ME early on.

10. **There are several internal balance mechanisms and variations of ways to play.** If you and your group feel that playing the vanilla game of TS has grown stale or that one side wins too much, you can easily alter the balance. You can handicap, use optional cards, bring in the Turn Zero promo/expansion, alternative Space Race, or the Late War only variant.

----------

11. Bonus point: there is a fine app for this game that you can get for usually around 10 bucks. Personally, I don't like board game apps because I overplay them and then never want to play my board game version, but if you're into that sort of thing, it's a cheaper way of finding out if the game is for you.

I hope this helps you decide if Twilight Struggle is for you. Happy gaming.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, Twilight Struggle is a reenactment of the Cold War. &lt;strong&gt;The game does a wonderful job of immersing you into the era through the events, card artwork, and game play.&lt;/strong&gt; You don&amp;#39;t have to love the Cold War to love the game, but an interest in history, politics, and the machinations of global superpowers doesn&amp;#39;t hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The components are not going to blow you away.&lt;/strong&gt; There is nothing wrong with them, but these are your standard fare GMT components. They get the job done. A collector&amp;#39;s edition was released for Twilight Struggle, but it was more of an exercise in teaching GMT to never do one again than a representation of what a collector&amp;#39;s edition ought to be. No one was really satisfied with the outcome after seeing what &amp;quot;Collector&amp;#39;s Edition&amp;quot; meant for games like Small World, War of the Ring, and Takenoko.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The replayability is found in the cards.&lt;/strong&gt; Every game will be unique because you will have a different hand and different choices to make. Your opponent will too. If you know Middle East is going to score in the first round because you hold the card, your strategy becomes starkly different than if you don&amp;#39;t have it. You also know that by holding it in round 1, you may end up scoring it again in round 3, so it is vitally important to build up your influence in the ME early on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There are several internal balance mechanisms and variations of ways to play.&lt;/strong&gt; If you and your group feel that playing the vanilla game of TS has grown stale or that one side wins too much, you can easily alter the balance. You can handicap, use optional cards, bring in the Turn Zero promo/expansion, alternative Space Race, or the Late War only variant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bonus point: there is a fine app for this game that you can get for usually around 10 bucks. Personally, I don&amp;#39;t like board game apps because I overplay them and then never want to play my board game version, but if you&amp;#39;re into that sort of thing, it&amp;#39;s a cheaper way of finding out if the game is for you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this helps you decide if Twilight Struggle is for you. Happy gaming.&lt;/p&gt;

I have a rather simple question. I have always used only two brands of sleeves - Mayday and FFG -0 due to availability in the stores around me. It's my understanding that despite being supposed to have the same size, standard poker card sleeves will all be a bit smaller or larger depending on the brand.

I was wondering if there are standard 63.5 x 88 sleeves that would actually be a tighter fit at the top than the FFG and Mayday. I find that the sleeves are too ""long"".

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Once Yokohama was just a fishing village, but now at the beginning of the Meiji era it's becoming a harbor open to foreign countries and one of the leading trade cities of Japan. As a result, many Japanese products such as copper and raw silk are collected in Yokohama for export to other countries. At the same time, the city is starting to incorporate foreign technology and culture, with even the streets becoming more modernized. In the shadow of this development was the presence of many Yokohama merchants.

In YOKOHAMA, each player is a merchant in the Meiji period, trying to gain fame from a successful business, and to do so they need to build a store, broaden their sales channels, learn a variety of techniques, and (of course) respond to trade orders from abroad.

------------------

##[Galaxy Trucker](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/31481/galaxy-trucker)

* **Designer:** Vlaada Chvátil

* **Publisher:** Rio Grande Games

* **Year Released:** 2007

* **Game Mechanic:** Tile Placement, Real Time, Dice Rolling

* **Number of Players:** 2-4 (best with 4)

* **Playing Time:** 60 minutes

* **Expansions:** [The Big Expansion]( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/38378/galaxy-trucker-the-big-expansion), [Another Big Expansion]( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/97845/galaxy-trucker-another-big-expansion); standalone [Anniversary Edition](http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/140068/galaxy-trucker-anniversary-edition) which includes all expansions and the [Even-Steven Cards]( http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/132435/galaxy-trucker-even-steven-cards), along with a comic

In Galaxy Truckers, players will be building space ships and then piloting them through all sorts of obstacles, trying to survive and make as many credits as possible by selling goods and completing objectives, and being the fastest.  Ships are built in real time by placing tiles next to one another following a set of rules to fill up your space ships.  Space ships can (and should) contain engines to go fast, lasers to shoot obstacles, crew cabins to house people you can use to complete objectives, shields to protect you, batteries to power things, storage containers to hold goods that you can sell, and aliens to help you.  After the build phase, ships are checked for illegal tile placements and then the ships are piloted through a number of different things including planets where players can pick up goods, meteor showers that will damage you if you can’t shoot them first, space pirates that will shoot you if you aren’t powerful enough to shoot them, among others.  If anyone survives the round, they will get bonuses for the order they finish in and “pretty” ships, and can sell any goods they were carrying for money.  The game ends after three rounds when the player with the most credits wins.

&lt;p&gt;In Galaxy Truckers, players will be building space ships and then piloting them through all sorts of obstacles, trying to survive and make as many credits as possible by selling goods and completing objectives, and being the fastest.  Ships are built in real time by placing tiles next to one another following a set of rules to fill up your space ships.  Space ships can (and should) contain engines to go fast, lasers to shoot obstacles, crew cabins to house people you can use to complete objectives, shields to protect you, batteries to power things, storage containers to hold goods that you can sell, and aliens to help you.  After the build phase, ships are checked for illegal tile placements and then the ships are piloted through a number of different things including planets where players can pick up goods, meteor showers that will damage you if you can’t shoot them first, space pirates that will shoot you if you aren’t powerful enough to shoot them, among others.  If anyone survives the round, they will get bonuses for the order they finish in and “pretty” ships, and can sell any goods they were carrying for money.  The game ends after three rounds when the player with the most credits wins.&lt;/p&gt;

This game is so beautiful in it’s simplicity. It’s the perfect example of a game that wasn’t over produced, and rightly so, the game play is phenomenal, so it really didn’t need to have hoards of minis, though, based on the quantities of tokens each clan gets, I don’t think that would have even been a posibility.    


The game may be cute AF, but don’t kid yourself for one second. You’re about to enter a battle among the woodland creatures to seize the throne back from the Marquise de Cat. The devious little kitty clan. No seriously, they look like they want to mess people up.    


For those that don’t know much about Root, it’s an asymmetrical game, meaning, each clan or faction that you play will play completely different from one an another. So you essentially have to learn the game 6 different times. This can be a challenge for a lot of people, but I promise you that it’ll be worth seeing these little woodland creatures battle it out.      

Now I have noticed in polling large social media groups that certain clans tend to have an easier time winning. The Woodland Alliance and the Vagabond have been performing the best, then the Marquise de Cat.    

I wouldn’t say there are balance issues, as the first couple players typically finish fairly close to each other, it’s more that because the game is so new, it’s hard enough to master your own clan, let alone remembering and predicting everyone elses strategy. One thing that I did like is that everyone has the same goal, 30 VPs, so that is at least easy to visualize when someone is getting close.
     
But it’s very much a game of “if such and such clan is left unchecked, they win” kind of game. So with everyone just learning, it’s really easy to forget what someone else can do and then they basically run away with it. 
      
The other thing is that proportionally speaking, you’ll see certain base game clans played more often, so proportionally, they have a higher chance of winning. However, so far the Lizard Clan seem to have the most difficult time winning. 
      
So based on all that, I do want to give it time and more plays to touch on the subject of clan balance. 
       
I was so beyond pleased with this game, though I was hesitant at first because I didn’t totally love Vast, and I also wasn’t thrilled with Heroes of Land Sea and Air, all asymmetrical games. But this one does it wonderfully. I’m so happy to have this game in my collection and I can see me playing it for years to come.

Kickstarter summaries and board game table companies going out of business or not delivery as expected. Finally got around to posting my build.  


I decided I would make a [Denis inspired vaulted board game table.](https://imgur.com/a/yLBBZF8)  


This was not something I took lightly. I did custom furniture design for a small furniture company in Regina Saskatchewan. The carpenter there taught me joint detailing and material selection. I was able to provide them with presentation drawings ([Sketchup](https://app.sketchup.com/app?hl=en) fyi free to model) that they could show to clients wiling to spend large amounts of money on custom tables and bedroom sets. It was a great relationship. I got paid and I learned a lot. Since then I also have built a few prior pieces of furniture (custom shoe cabinet, bedside tables, custom wardrobe with integrated shoe storage built into the stairs). So I had the tools already and have done other renovations in our houses. What made me decide to do this. I saw the prices and the options that were available. There were and are a lot of options and companies. The issue was I couldn't afford to pay $1000+ when my board game collection is maybe worth that now. So how could I get the benefit without the cost. Build it myself. It took more planning and detailing than it did to construct it and finish it.   


If you are thinking about making one it is not as hard as you are making it out to be. Yes I had some experience making furniture. But honestly the joints aren't difficult. Kreg jig and you are good to go. The only barrier is having the tools and the time. The table is based on[the Denis from Geeknsons](http://www.geeknson.com/portfolio/denis-gaming-and-dining-table/#Add-ons). They make a great product, but I just couldn't justify paying the cost. Call me frugal but I would rather spend it on games. I ended spending just under $400 complete with finishes which surprisingly was the most expensive part. This included a used router and bits and all materials. By the way 3 coats of poly urethane isn't cheap. But that is what you get for using soft cheap spruce pine fur (SPF) lumber.  


Why a vaulted table? In this case it can be used with or without a vault. I use the vault mostly to prevent having things spill off the table or spill on. If you have ever had a drink spill on the table while gaming you know what I am talking about. We also play with the insert at the table surface as well. Just depends on the game and whether or not there are dice. Dice are great to chuck against the vault. Basically massive dice tray. Also no components get bumped. The other benefit is those long games can be paused and not disturbed. How often does that happen maybe 2 times a year but when it does is great to just remove the leaves and bam. Gaming instantly from where you left off. Unless the kids find a way to disturb the table.  Another benefit is if you know you are going to play 2 games that night one can be set up on top and then removed to reveal the one underneath. This is great for games with long set up times. Think Gloomhaven, Twilight Imperium, Eclipse or other large games that setup time is extensive. The custom rail is not being used other than drink holders at this time. But now that it is there if you want something it can be added. That is something makes if flexible in the future.  


Is a custom table worth it? A qualified yes. It wasn't worth $1000+ for me.  But $400 was something I could afford and still get a large playing surface. (3""-11"" x 5'-0""). If you play a ton of games totally worth it. If this doubles as a dining table then hell yah. If you can build it the value is that much more. Also it is extremely rewarding and a great learning experience. I was great to build again. I enjoyed the building almost as much as I enjoy the board time.    


Take a chance and expand your skill set. Also if you know that there is something that you want incorporated into your table you can make it happen. Thanks for looking and if you want more information send me a message and I would be happy to help.

EDIT: Link error.  
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seems to me that board game tables are all the talk on the forum these days. Kickstarter summaries and board game table companies going out of business or not delivery as expected. Finally got around to posting my build.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I decided I would make a &lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/yLBBZF8""&gt;Denis inspired vaulted board game table.&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was not something I took lightly. I did custom furniture design for a small furniture company in Regina Saskatchewan. The carpenter there taught me joint detailing and material selection. I was able to provide them with presentation drawings (&lt;a href=""https://app.sketchup.com/app?hl=en""&gt;Sketchup&lt;/a&gt; fyi free to model) that they could show to clients wiling to spend large amounts of money on custom tables and bedroom sets. It was a great relationship. I got paid and I learned a lot. Since then I also have built a few prior pieces of furniture (custom shoe cabinet, bedside tables, custom wardrobe with integrated shoe storage built into the stairs). So I had the tools already and have done other renovations in our houses. What made me decide to do this. I saw the prices and the options that were available. There were and are a lot of options and companies. The issue was I couldn&amp;#39;t afford to pay $1000+ when my board game collection is maybe worth that now. So how could I get the benefit without the cost. Build it myself. It took more planning and detailing than it did to construct it and finish it.   &lt;/p&gt;

It occured to me that it would actually be difficult, or almost impossible, to get an incredibly low score in either game. The games are just tuned so that no matter what action you take, you're still making *some* progress.

In Castles, you're buying a room every turn and rooms will *always* give you points. Even if you're just getting the lowest scoring room, weakest room synergies, not completing rooms, AND avoiding all the common objectives you'll still likely end up with a significant castle.

[After writing this I realized that in Castles you could simply spend every turn getting money and not buying anything OR only buying hallways/stairs, and get a super low score. Oops.]

However, on the other hand, if everyone at a table got together and colluded to give **only one player** all the rooms, you wind up with 3 players with only foyers and one castle with 44 *!@#$ing* rooms. The points from just buying the rooms would total around 80 points *at the very least*.

And that's not even counting room synergy bonuses, completed room bonuses, 32 points from common goals, and a TON of points from bonus objectives. All together the points total could easily add up to over 300.

An average score for me in a game of Castles is only barely over 100.

My first game of 7 Wonders felt incredibly similar in that every card would get me *some* progress, but it would be hard to really sandbag the game. It makes me wonder what an ""optimized"" game would look like/score like. I can imagine it being similarly crazy high scoring. 

This idea could be applied to LOTS of games though. Ticket to Ride's lowest score could be in the negative hundreds (assuming you can go lower than 0), but I can't imagine the highest score being above 250. Dominion would have a lowest score of -10 or -30 if I remember correctly, but a highest score could be essentially infinite depending on what expansion cards you're using. Catan would be pretty simple at 2 and 11, but I don't know what special rules the expansions might have that could change that. 

Anyway, now that I've opened this box of worms,  I'm super curious about it. What other games can you think of that might fit this theme?

&lt;p&gt;I just got Azul yesterday and played it once, so I’m not well versed on the gameplay yet, but it came with a flyer for the jokers and promo tiles which piqued my curiosity.&lt;/p&gt;

1. There’s no competition. Just one player min-maxing as hard as possible.

2. Only use tiles from the base set. All the expansions confuse the issue.

3. Each individual move has to be legal. You only have the set number of meeples, you play one tile at a time, you only get points for features you have a guy on, etc.

4. You can play the tiles in any order. No random drawing.

Sometimes, you get backed up against a wall, and you have to go all-in on a strategy. Yes, I realize we might lose in that way. Yes, I know we are wildly exposed and if these 3 things happen in a row we lose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there comes a point where your &amp;quot;path to victory&amp;quot; is becoming narrower and narrower. Now picking exactly when is the best time to go &amp;quot;all-in&amp;quot; is definitely one of the hardest choices in a game, but not picking one at all is the worst. I hate watching games slip away because people are trying so hard to not lose that they stop trying to win. Eventually, as the game is designed to do, they get overwhelmed and it&amp;#39;s all over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even in retrospect, this concept seems hard to communicate. I feel like people are more inclined to say &amp;quot;well there was nothing we could have done&amp;quot; rather than think about the potential risks they could have taken to win.&lt;/p&gt;

I played this again with the Shadows Flicker Like Flame spirit as I ""understood"" how this spirit plays.

I ran the game with 1 tile, 4 fear for the pool, no blight card, 5 blight in the pool, and started the game with the initial spirit cards in hand BUT placed the ""ideal"" cards for the spirit on top of each of the power decks.

This game was a failure at turn 4; all blight placed on the board I was able to generate a couple of fear cards that did absolutely nothing, the amount of energy generated was not enough to fight off anything, or to even gather enough cards to push them around. What happened was that my 2 initial spirit tokens on the highest Jungle were forced to sit there and let a town and city ravage that every turn killing off those 2 default placements and spreading blight everywhere.

I did not find this solo play fun and I do not see how this spirit can win in a solo run.

What do you recommend I do with this spirit as generating fear and pushing/pulling invaders does not help enough to see the light at the end of the tunnel?

Overall, 8/10 game, imo, but this dropped my hype down for a new playthru to a 3/5

**Win Condition Questions:** This spirit generates fear, but there are too many fear cards at 3/3/3 for each lvl 1,2,3, so in this solo circumstance how can i win off of fear so quickly if there are too many fear cards? In solo play do we cut the number of fear cards down or does it always stay at 3/3/3?

I've been in the hobby for a bit more than a decade now. It all started when my cousin made me play with her at **The Settlers of Catan** as well as the card game of the same name. Even though I don't play those games anymore, I probably will keep them for that emotional value. Those are my first acquisitions, over ten years ago. This year, I bought **Alchemists** and **Decrypto**, both incredible in their own right.

For my tastes, I find my collection well-balanced. I'm not so big on thematic games so I only have a few and rarely play them. Looking at it though, I wish I'd have some negotiation games. I'm looking forward to **Trading on the Tigris** to fill that void though.

It might not appear through my collection, but my favorite game is **Through the Ages**, I played the copy you see here well over 300 times, probably around 400 times even. Even after all these games, the re-release made it basically obsolete. I can barely look at it now! I miss the small circular wooden pegs, but they made it so much better by rebalancing price, leaders, and most importantly military. I tried the old version a few times since, and it just felt barbaric. I can't imagine how much more I would've played the original if it had been like the re-release. What does come through in the picture is our love for **Hanabi**. I have my copy, she has hers, and we got gifted a deluxe edition.

Some games I don't play as much as I wished. Namely **Die Macher** and **Automobiles**. I love them, but they're either too long or too dry for most people I play with. I also have a copy of **Duck Dealer**, my only Splotter game, and never played. Nobody is interested in it and, I must admit, the game doesn't sound really good on paper. I'm still trying to get it played.

I'm not the type to go in COMC threads (which is apparent in my initial posting of this, as I completely disregarded COMC guidelines), never felt inclined to show my collection either, but now I do! We just moved and bought an ikea Expedit shelf to be able to store my collection all in the same place. Our last place was so small we had to separate de games in three different rooms.

thanks fellow tabletoppers!

basically, fought back and forth and eventually came down to $0.90 and was told 'they do this all the time and it was really my fault for not using friends and family'.  I refused still on principle at this point (also read paypal's return shipping that if i got screwed on wrong item or damaged i would still need o ship back on my dime).  They wanted me to drive cross country and pick up as they weren't mailing it to me.  Reported to paypal and copied in the emails, case was dropped by PayPal once i was refunded.

5minute dungeon is a co-op Card based dungeon crawler, 2-5 players pick a class with a colored deck that coincides with each class. Each player draws cards to fight, monsters, obstacles, people, and mini bosses. Each door card will force players to play cards from there hand to beat the door card and move on to the next door card in the deck. Depending on what final boss you are fighting depends on on many door cards you must defeat in order to face the final boss within the 5 mins. 

Pros
-Super easy to learn good for all ages
-it’s like munchkin but I don’t want to kill everyone
-everyone has to work together and think fast
-games only take 5 mins. +setup 
- class cards look amazing
- overall art on cards looks great
-only 20 bucks

Some of the game can feel repetitive you will always have to find new ways to get more cards in your hand But id like to see more event cards that cause you to lose your hand or fight two bosses at once kind of thing.  

Overall 
Great game happy to have it in my collection and I would recommend to anyone looking for something new To spice up game night. 


Edit: I’m a fool theses cards are perfect the ink is not smeared they have a rustic look to them that looks awesome. They a good thick playing cards. 

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;5minute dungeon is a co-op Card based dungeon crawler, 2-5 players pick a class with a colored deck that coincides with each class. Each player draws cards to fight, monsters, obstacles, people, and mini bosses. Each door card will force players to play cards from there hand to beat the door card and move on to the next door card in the deck. Depending on what final boss you are fighting depends on on many door cards you must defeat in order to face the final boss within the 5 mins. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros
-Super easy to learn good for all ages
-it’s like munchkin but I don’t want to kill everyone
-everyone has to work together and think fast
-games only take 5 mins. +setup 
- class cards look amazing
- overall art on cards looks great
-only 20 bucks &lt;/p&gt;

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

Town League Hockey is a mid-weight game about playing a match of hockey. It was created to fill this niche because I found all hockey board games were either very light or very heavy. Town League Hockey is simple enough to learn in a few minutes, but deep enough that you will be mulling over your choices as you decide how to respond to on-ice events, where to skate with the puck to get the best shot, and when to rest or play your best players.

A single match should last about an hour, so you could play a quick game, or leave it set up for a while to play out a playoff series. i'm copying this bit from my store page but that's ok because i wrote it anyway.

should note that this is the basic game. there are 3 expansions that are actually finished, but i can't release on game crafter yet ($$$), and also a deluxe edition on the way (also $$$).

Dear Traders,

First let me thank you for all of your support. I wanted to build something new, something bold, and have it change the way we thought about used board games. With your help I believe I accomplished that.

The problem with board games is their weight to value ratio. Even with amazing rates from UPS it was still very expensive to both receive and send games. The solution was to have Amazon fulfill outgoing orders. That cut the sending cost in half. Which we paid forward in the form of better buying prices and free outgoing shipping. What we did not expect was how poorly Amazon is actually run. Our initial tests went quite well except for the fact that sometimes it took them two weeks to process incoming inventory. When we made the full leap and sent our entire inventory in the nightmare began. Their receiving team labeled all of the new inventory as used. This caused us to lose tens of thousands in value instantly and wreaked havoc on our databases. It took literally over twenty different people and 6 months to get a solution. The solution was to send us back the mislabeled games, we would remove the labels and send the inventory back in. We received the inventory, removed the labels and repacked the games for shipment. Sadly, their system refused to let us send it back. There was a promotion at the time that allowed sellers to take back any inventory at Amazon's warehouse for free, but they could not send it back for two months. We pleaded to get an exception as the inventory was removed because of their error and had nothing to do with the promotion. Two months went by and the only response we could get was, ""Someone is working on it."" We eventually spoke to Jeff Bezos' personal support team. They recognized that the problem was their fault, vowed to train their staff better and gave us a whopping $150 in fees back...

As there is no fulfillment system in this country priced anywhere close to what Amazon can offer I decided to shut down the business instead of risking lengthy delays and poor customer service. I hope that one day there will be an alternative and I or maybe even one of you could try this concept again. 

Some of you still have credit in the system. If you believe you have credit please reply with a list of any non Asmodee games you would like and your current mailing address. I will reply with what we can provide you given your current store credit. You must send this list in by Thursday September 13th. We will place and order with distribution to get you your games. They should arrive at your doorstep within 10-14 days. Please note this is the final notice. The company will be dissolved within the next few weeks.

Thank you for your past support and current understanding. I hope to see you guys around the game table someday.

Sincerely,

I've used them a couple times in the past to trade and buy some games so this is disappointing.

I wonder how common this problem is in dealing with Amazon.  I remember reading they have problems filtering counterfeit games out of their inventories as well.

in your opinion, which virtual (iOS ideally but Steam is ok) boardgame has the strongest asynchronous online multiplayer? 

&amp;#x200B;

I am primarily thinking about rather heavy games such as Through the Ages, Terra Mystica, or games such as Race for the Galaxy.

I'm just some nobody who is a deck building game enthusiast. I'm looking to collect some data about what everyone else loves about this wonderful genre and where they think the genre could or should go in the future.

I'd be eternally grateful if you could take some time out of your day to do this Survey and maybe even pass it on to other people in your friend group who also share this passion.

Let me give some of my opinions. The first game that I played in the genre was Dominion way back in 2010 or early 2011. After gobbling up all the available expansions and trying to ""unlock achievements"" such as winning with a Rats deck, I discovered DC Deck Building Game in Fall or 2014. I really really enjoyed Dominion, but I fell in love the the Cryptozoic franchise. Having a character to play as that completely changed the gameplay experience every time had me hooked. To this day, I pick up every expansion and I play the game with my roommates and various other friends almost every night.

I hope I didn't paint your opinions too much! I'd love to discuss this genre more in comments below but again, it would mean a lot if you could fill out the linked survey. The more detailed the better!

Cheers!

I&amp;#39;m just some nobody who is a deck building game enthusiast. I&amp;#39;m looking to collect some data about what everyone else loves about this wonderful genre and where they think the genre could or should go in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d be eternally grateful if you could take some time out of your day to do this Survey and maybe even pass it on to other people in your friend group who also share this passion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let me give some of my opinions. The first game that I played in the genre was Dominion way back in 2010 or early 2011. After gobbling up all the available expansions and trying to &amp;quot;unlock achievements&amp;quot; such as winning with a Rats deck, I discovered DC Deck Building Game in Fall or 2014. I really really enjoyed Dominion, but I fell in love the the Cryptozoic franchise. Having a character to play as that completely changed the gameplay experience every time had me hooked. To this day, I pick up every expansion and I play the game with my roommates and various other friends almost every night.&lt;/p&gt;

Just last week I was here, asking your opinions about Pandemic Legacy. Obviously, I followed your advice, bought it and played 5 games of vanilla Pandemic already...really great stuff, I'm super psyched for Legacy!  
  
Last night, I had the best game so far: I'll spare you the buildup, let's just say that we probably made some mistakes but did decently overall. Outbreak marker was at 4, we have 3 cures already and the board doesn't look too bad, a couple of blacks and yellows.   
  
However, we suddenly notice that we only have 5 more cards to draw, so we have to get the yellow cure within the next 3 turns. We do have 5 yellow cards in the game, split onto all 3 players though. Since we have a ton of of city cards to move with, the helicopter special move and the ability to trade cards without having to be in the city of question, we have loads of possibilities to perfect the 3 remaining moves.   
  
After 10 minutes of super intense planning and honing, we work out a sequence that will get us the 4th cure on the very last action of the 3rd turn; i.e. right before having to draw 2 cards and losing because here is just 1 left. During those moves we won't have time to heal at all though, but we don't have a choice. So we go ahead with our master plan, only to draw the last epidemic immediately after the first turn is done. Just 1 outbreak though, we're still good.  
2nd turn, I take 2 yellow cards and move to the research centre where my mate will then take 3 yellow off of me and research the cure. Last time to infect, we draw Bagdad, outbreak happens, we're at 6 now. Next card, some yellow city, nothing happens. 3rd and final card before our plan comes to fruition: Cairo, which just got it's 3rd counter during the Bagdad outbreak...Riyadh also has 3 and gets hit by Cairo, therefore now reaching Karachi which also got 3 when Bagdad broke out and BAM we have no more black cubes. Also, the outbreak track has reached 8. Also, we're just 1 move away from researching the final cure which ALSO would've JUST saved us from losing to the card limit...  
  
I'm still in awe by how well designed the win/loss mechanics in this game are. While stuff like this obviously doesn't happen every time it's amazing balancing nonetheless. All 3 of the possible ways to lose the game feel totally relevant and we felt very driven by the need to do something about them, without being overwhelmed and only playing boring, reactionary moves.  
  
Anyway, I guess none of this is news to you but I still had to share, and also thank you for encouraging me to get this amazing game.

Anyone else finding that you want to improve the component quality in some your favorite games? 

I really enjoy playing Raiders of the North Sea. So much so that I saw a post in Board Game Geek's Facebook page that had some upgraded components that had viking tankards for beer and barrels for provisions. Poster was kind enough to let me know where I could find them on Thingiverse [(viking tankard](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2882021) and [rope barrel](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2950487) if you are wondering). I had a friend print a couple to [test tankards and barrels](https://imgur.com/Wc8QyqE) to make sure the scale was right and they turned out pretty good just from the raw prints. I decided to paint the [barrels](https://imgur.com/OmKdVVM) and the [tankards](https://imgur.com/0IxRUcc) and I think they really turned out great. [Take a look for yourself](https://imgur.com/xCZOxJJ). I really enjoyed painting them and the froth was fun to try and emulate. Haven't done anything with clay in a long time.  

Next on my list is Terraforming Mars. Trying to customize the temperature track and oxygen track. Will post pictures of those next when I get them printed up. Still in concept sketches right now. 

Wondering what next level customization people have done to make their tabletop gaming experience just that little extra bit better. Custom Player Aids to full on custom player mats.

Hej

My name is Pavel and I´m working on a little geek-trivia game. 

How to play (short version)

Choose a character, answer questions and get points. You must spend those points on either movement or magical items from the treasure deck. Items can help you in your quest or be useful to backstab your friends.  First player to reach the end of the dungeon is is the winner. 

There´s a longer more in-depth description the link along with some yearly renders.

I´ve also just set up a little page where I´m going to collect and publish my work (ypotato.com). 

This is my first real game design and I would love to know what you think. Any feedback is helpful. I´m also open for ideas of what to ad and how to improve the game. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hej&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Choose a character, answer questions and get points. You must spend those points on either movement or magical items from the treasure deck. Items can help you in your quest or be useful to backstab your friends.  First player to reach the end of the dungeon is is the winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There´s a longer more in-depth description the link along with some yearly renders. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/gallery/l4oUt7f""&gt;https://imgur.com/gallery/l4oUt7f&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I´ve also just set up a little page where I´m going to collect and publish my work (ypotato.com). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my first real game design and I would love to know what you think. Any feedback is helpful. I´m also open for ideas of what to ad and how to improve the game. &lt;/p&gt;

[2nd Breakfast](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/woodedrealms/2nd-breakfast-an-affordable-quality-board-game-tab/description)

*full featured hardwood table at one price*

This table comes in one (two) sizes, has one (two) price point(s), and will have a limited addons. Includes a table and legs, leaves (4x reversible with gutter redirection), 6 (2x2 + 2x1) cupholders, 4 shelves, USB (8) and AC (2) power, RGB+W lighting, a movable skirt (hides rails), a removable/reversible playmat, and an acrylic sheet. Currently possible addons include ""premium accessories"" from C4Labs ($100?), varied height legs (coffee, dining, bar), chairs (with cushion colors matching the playfield and a secret compartment), acrylic leaves, and trench guards. Currently known customization options are 4 stains (plus unfinished) and 4 playmat colors. Ships with only the legs requiring assembly. Made in Datong, China in one of the owner's (Michael) factory. High shipping costs (full tabletops are expensive to ship), but low unit costs. Reddit AMA and In-Person Event at Arcane Comics in Shoreline, WA on the 17th from 0900-1100, and the 22nd from 1400-1800 respectively.

Topped Table Dimensions: 60"" x 40"" x \~32"" or 16.67 ft2

Vault Dimensions: 52"" x 32"" x \~2.875"" or 11.56 ft2

Other Table Sizes: XL = 68"" x 44"" x \~32"" or 20.78 ft2 (vault: 15 ft2)

[The Jasper](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1296268806/the-jasper-a-board-gaming-table/comments)

*made in the USA barebones hardwood game table*

This table comes in one size and has two price points depending on if you want to include a topper in your pledge. It will use a pledge manager system to manage addons, so some of the cost (including the topper and its shipping) can be split off until after the campaign. The base table pledge and shipping are very comparable to the 2nd Breakfast. It comes flat-ish-packed in two boxes and requires moderate assembly. Includes a table with legs and a (gray for now, possibly a 2nd color) playmat. Addons include cup holders ($14 - can hold them in 8 fixed positions), additional playmats ($29), dining topper ($299 - 3 pieces tongue and groove with rubber gasket), and wing shelves ($79 - construction includes trench guards). Can be customized with 2 stain colors (plus unfinished).

Topped Table Dimensions: 65.6"" x 42.6"" x 30.6"" or 19.41 ft2

Vault Dimensions: 60"" x 36"" x 2.25"" or 15 ft2

[GameChanger](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/972632882/gamechanger-game-tables-and-table-toppers/description)

*cut down, non-hardwood table with high modularity*

A bunch of backer tiers for a bunch of different table sizes and bundle contents. Using pledge manager to deal with add-ons. Base tables are bare-bones. They come with the tabletop (and legs, if you're buying a full table version). They ship flat and require significant assembly. Customizable in 3 colors (leaves come in 2 + possible wood-stained versions). Addons include: table tops ($60-$125), topper extensions ($119-$149), extension tops ($39-$49), cupholders ($19), playmats ($40-$90), big pads($39-$45), DM screens ($129), dice towers ($15), card holders ($39), dice trays ($45), legs, tabletop protectors ($55-$115), AC/USB outlets ($39), and chairs ($199/2 for gamechangers, $279/2 for elites).

Topped Table Dimensions: 64.5"" x 46.5"" x 30"" or 20.83 ft2

Vault Dimensions: 59"" x 41"" x 2"" or 16.8 ft2

Other Table Sizes: 2.4 = 55.5"" x 29.5"" x 20"" or 11.37 ft2 (vault: 9.03 ft2) | 4.4 = 55.5"" x 55.5"" x 30"" or 21.39 ft2 (vault: 17.36 ft2) | 4.6 = 79.5"" x 55.5"" x 30"" or 30.64 ft2 (vault: 25.69 ft2) 

**Other Notes:**

The biggest risk is clearly the 2nd Breakfast. It's Wooded Realms' first Kickstarter. The other two companies have been through this before, and delivered. (Not without issues, of course, but it helps to have the experience to learn from!) The Jasper is made by people with four years of experience, and many thousands of tables fulfilled, so it's likely the safest bet—particularly as they've consistently been touted as having fully taken care of the issues which arose. The GameChanger's company, Wood Robot, has had a fair number of (service/logistical) issues reported with their Elite series.

The smallest ""dining table"" footprint is available from the 2nd Breakfast, at 60"" x 40"". The GameChanger offers a smaller 2.4 size, but that's very much a coffee table format. The topped sizes for ""dining tables"" running from smallest to largest square footage are: 2nd Breakfast, The Jasper, 2nd Breakfast XL, and GameChanger.

The 2nd Breakfast campaign offers the most full-featured table(s), and The Jasper the least. The Game-Changer has by far the most options—it can rival (or possibly even exceed) the 2nd Breakfast in features if everything is added in.

Some Category Wins:

* Bang for Buck seems to heavily favor the $650 2nd Breakfast (or even the 2nd Breakfast XL at $850).
* Cheapest Up Front (with option to eventually accessorize your way to victory for an unknown extra amount) is the GameChanger. (Honorable mention for ""Most Portable"", since some of these are just table toppers.)
* ""Made in the USA"" option is The Jasper. (Also, in a fine bit of irony, it's ~~the only option~~ confirmed for Canadians. 2nd Breakfast just promised CAN shipping though... but GameChanger isn't even talking about it.)

**FWIW, here's the tiers...they do NOT match up well because of the features/addons so the most important thing is to look at what you are actually getting for the money...these campaigns are nowhere near comparable in what they provide you with your pledge! (Also, I am probably wrong on shipping costs for some of these. Please verify for yourself. Plus, addons will likely run you more for some of these campaigns...)**

2nd Breakfast: $500+$150 shipping or $600+$250 shipping for the XL

The Jasper: $599+$69 shipping or $898+$99? shipping (with topper)

GameChanger: $199+$69 shipping (2.4 topper), $299+$69 shipping (2.4 table, 3.5 topper, or 2.4 topper bundle), $349+$69 shipping (4.4 topper), $399+$69 shipping (3.5 table, 3.5 topper bundle, or 3.7 topper), $459+$69 shipping (4.4 table, 2.4 table bundle, 4.4 topper bundle, or 4.6 topper), $499+$69 shipping (4.6 table or 3.7 topper bundle), $599+$69 shipping (3.5 table bundle), $659+$69 shipping (4.4 table bundle), $699+$69 shipping (4.6 table bundle or 4.6 topper bundle), $999+shipping (3.5 table chair bundle), $1059+shipping (4.4 table chair bundle), $1299+shipping (4.6 table chair bundle)

My wife and I bought Dead of Winter and The Long Night recently and love them. We enjoy them so much we wanted to try a campaign version of it. I DID NOT do most of the leg work on this. It's originally laid out in a BGG post I found by  'quasar sevilla' or 'quasarsevilla' (I honestly dont know why it's listed twice, I dont use BGG much). And I have no idea if this person is a Reddit user or not (u/quasarsevilla). (Edit: Yep!) I altered, tweaked, and rewrote some of the stuff he did, but it wouldnt be enough to not get me dinged for plagarism in a class, so I want to make sure everyone is aware this is his original idea and mostly his work.

Anyway, we found this. I've adjusted it to what you see below. I wanted to share so others can enjoy it and cause I think quasar did a great job with the original version (  r/[https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1537603/dead-winter-campaign](https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1537603/dead-winter-campaign))

**2. – Crossroads Cards**

\~If a Crossroad event ‘fires’ on a player’s turn, it should be removed from the campaign (not shuffled back into the deck between chapters) unless the deck becomes empty.

**3. - Carry over effects:**

Characters\*\*:\*\*

\~Each player is dealt an additional character at the beginning of the campaign to choose from, but keep the normal amount of characters you would play with based on the number of players in your game.

\~At the end of a chapter, if you have more characters in play than you began that chapter with, you must shuffle the additional characters back into the character deck (If you started with 2, all but 2 have to get shuffled back in). You must keep all of the surviving characters you started the mission with minus one (So if you start with 3 and one dies, you can replace the dead one and one additional one). If you end the chapter with fewer characters or the same number of characters you started the chapter with, only those characters carry over to the next chapter.

\~Any characters chosen to be shuffled back into the character deck who have items equipped roll a die. On a 6, the item stays attached, and if you discover that character in a later chapter, they come into play with the item still equipped.

\~Once a character has been ‘discovered’ once by a Survivor Item card in the campaign (or who has ever been a starting character in any chapter), that character no longer bring any helpless survivors with them if they are discovered again by another Survivor Item card.

Equipment:\~Characters can maintain their equipment between chapters. For each item you control at the end of a chapter, roll a die. If you roll a 6, you may keep that item, carrying it over into the next chapter. Otherwise shuffle it back into its item deck per the normal rules. Any item carried over takes the place of a Starter Item you will be dealt at the beginning of the next chapter (as such, you can only carry over as many item cards between chapters as the number of Starter cards you’d normally begin the next chapter with.

\~If the item is already equipped to a character, it stays on that character. If it was in your hand, it stays in your hand.

\~The die roll of 6 must be done at the end of each chapter. Just because you rolled a 6 once doesn’t mean you keep the item in each chapter from then on.

\~Items kept on characters being shuffled back into the character deck do NOT count towards the total number of items you can carry over to begin a new chapter with.

Morale:\~If you finished a chapter with 1 morale, the next chapter will start with -1 point on morale.\~If you finished a chapter with 5 or more morale, the next chapter will start with +1 point of morale.

Food:\~For every 3 extra food in the food supply at the end of the chapter (after Colony Phase), add 1 food (round down) token in the food supply for the next chapter.\~Cannibals: If in a round you do not have enough food, you can decide to keep all the food and remove 1 helpless survivor and 2 points of moral.

Starvation token:\~Starvation token is kept for the next chapter.\~Starvation token can be removed in the next chapter if there are 2 extra food token at the end of the first round (after Colony Phase).\~Starvation token can be removed anytime if there are 4 extra food token at the end of a round (after Colony Phase).

Zombies:\~For every 3 zombies remaining in the colony at the end of a chapter, add 1 (round down) more zombie in the ordinary order in the next chapter. (Do not add zombies if the next chapter zombies number base will make zombies come into the colony)

Helpless survivors:\~For each 3 helpless survivors , add 1 helpless survivor (round down) for all future chapters. This helpless survivor does not count towards the 3 to carry another one over for all future chapters.\~You can decide to exile a helpless survivor. Roll a die, if the result is 3-6, decrease your morale by 1.

Wounds:\~At the end of a chapter, survivors will remove 1 wound from each character.

Bites:\~If a characters is bitten, roll 2 dice and resolve as following:If the result is not a double 6 (6-6), the survivor dies from the infection.If the result is a double 6, the character is immune to the infection and survives the bite. From now on, bite results from the Exposure Die will become a wound for this character.

Death:\~If a character dies from a bite, add it to The Graveyard.\~If a character has 3 wounds, roll a dice: If the result is 1-5, the character dies from the wounds. If the result is 6, remove this character from your play area, shuffle it into the character pile (remove any items equipped to it from the game). This character is still alive, but he/she told the group to left him/her behind, surviving on his/her own. If you find him again, he/she has 1 wound token. If they are found in the same chapter, they retain the equipped items they previously had. If they are not found again by the end of the chapter, roll a die per item equipped. On a 6, the item is still equipped.

**4. Vote to exile:**

\~I recommend not playing with Betrayers.\~Players who were exiled in one chapter keep being exiled in the next chapter.

\~If you begin a chapter exiled, your characters start on a single non-Colony location of your choice.\~Vote to re-accept: Survivors with characters in the colony can vote to re-accept a player exiled in the previous chapters.

**5. Secrets:**\~In campaign play, secrets are only used for bragging rights (unless somebody can think of something more interesting for them to be involved in).

**6. The Long Night**

\~Switch to all TLN cards in the item decks. Any items successfully carried over into TLN from ACR item decks continue to carry over til their owner fails to roll a 6.

\~TLN characters get added to the character deck along with any survivors of the ACR

\~Add TLN Crossroads cards to the existing Crossroads deck.

\~Yes, Side Effects from Raxon pills carry over from chapter to chapter

\~Once all of the ACR chapters are completed successfully, the TLN chapters should be shuffled (including the Raxon/Bandit card) and played in the shuffled order. When the Raxon/Bandit card comes up, roll a die. 1-3= Bandits, 4-6= Raxon. Play the entire story. Once that is complete, shuffle the Raxon/Bandit card back into the pile of unplayed chapters. When it comes up again, it’s the one that hasn’t already been played.

\~Once you’ve completed either the Raxon or Bandit story, roll a die at the beginning of every chapter (that isn’t the Raxon or Bandit story you haven’t played).

1-3= add the Raxon or Bandit module (whichever you played), 4-6= don’t add the module.

\~Once you’ve played both Raxon and Bandit stories:

1= add both modules, 2-3= add Raxon, 4-5= add Bandits, 6= don’t add either module.

&amp;#x200B;","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi there,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My wife and I bought Dead of Winter and The Long Night recently and love them. We enjoy them so much we wanted to try a campaign version of it. I DID NOT do most of the leg work on this. It&amp;#39;s originally laid out in a BGG post I found by  &amp;#39;quasar sevilla&amp;#39; or &amp;#39;quasarsevilla&amp;#39; (I honestly dont know why it&amp;#39;s listed twice, I dont use BGG much). And I have no idea if this person is a Reddit user or not (&lt;a href=""/u/quasarsevilla""&gt;u/quasarsevilla&lt;/a&gt;). (Edit: Yep!) I altered, tweaked, and rewrote some of the stuff he did, but it wouldnt be enough to not get me dinged for plagarism in a class, so I want to make sure everyone is aware this is his original idea and mostly his work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we found this. I&amp;#39;ve adjusted it to what you see below. I wanted to share so others can enjoy it and cause I think quasar did a great job with the original version (  r/&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1537603/dead-winter-campaign""&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/thread/1537603/dead-winter-campaign&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACR= A Crossroads Game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLN= The Long Night&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rules are normal except where stated:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. - Chapters (Missions):&lt;/strong&gt;ACR Chapters should be played in date order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When playing ACR chapters, the only things from TLN that should be used are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Graveyard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ‘Advancement’ module&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLN Fuel cards should replace ACR Fuel cards in Item Decks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLN Junk cards should replace ACR Junk cards in Item Decks&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. – Crossroads Cards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

My wife and I are huge Pandemic fans. We currently own the base game and all three expansions, and have played both Legacy seasons to date. We usually play the game a few times a week and usually two or three times per sitting. However, lately there started to get a sense of ""burnout"". I had seen and heard about The Cure, a dice version of Pandemic and had considered it, but always found a reason not to get it. This weekend however, I took the chance and purchased it. Dice games are really hit or miss for us. The randomness can sometimes hurt and yet sometimes the custom dice and strategy really make it a great game. After setting it up I was a little worried that the game was going to be a huge let down. However, after playing it the first time (and losing handedly), we saw a potential that this might be a good game. After 4 play-throughs this weekend, I am happy to report that this is a great game. 

 

The Look: I love any game with custom dice. The fact that each character had its own dice color, and own faces that are different from the rest is a huge thing for me. The player dice look really amazing. The disease dice are also custom to a point having different pip values that are designed to show up more often depending on the color. For example, the black disease (dice) has three faces that have three pips, meaning that on average 50% of the rolls will show up three. This allows for each disease to show up in certain areas more often than others. The cards look similar to the Pandemic original board game and look good. After that the look starts to go downhill very quickly. The ""board"" consists of several circles representing regions around the world. There are six of them. There is also an outbreak and epidemic tracker that while built well and looks ok, just doesn't seem like it fits. Once everything is on the table the game looks fine, but I think they could have made it look a little better. All in all I give the look of the game a 3.5 out of 5. If the board was a little better designed it would have been higher. 

  

Gameplay: For those of you familiar with Pandemic, the gameplay of Pandemic: The Cure will seem familiar. Each turn you will roll your player dice and perform the actions these dice allow you. You may at any time re-roll any number of dice, however, you risk rolling a biohazard symbol that will potentially increase the infection rate, and could cause an epidemic. You must find the cure for all four diseases to win. You can lose the game if you have 8 or more outbreaks, run out of disease dice, or roll too many biohazard symbols. After each players turn, you will select disease dice out of a bag equal to the current infection rate and roll them, placing them in each region you roll. If 3 dice of that color are already in that region, you have an outbreak and must place that dice on the next region. Each character in the game has its own special power to help deal with the situation. Game play is solid here and despite the randomness of dice rolls, it is really enjoyable. I give gameplay a 4 out of 5. 

  

Recommendation: I would recommend this game for fans of Pandemic looking to mix things up, or newer gamers. This game is lighter, quicker, and slightly more random than original Pandemic, and suits new gamers pretty well. The rules are simple enough for casual games to understand. For people who are not Pandemic fans and are into heavier games, I don't think this game is for you. 

  

Bottom Line: While I believe the original Pandemic, with its expansions is superior to Pandemic: The Cure, this doesn't mean Pandemic: The Cure is a bad game. In fact Pandemic: The Cure is a great game. If you love Pandemic but want to mix things up and get a breath of fresh air, this game is for you. Yes, there is more randomness. However, there are ways to mitigate some of it. While given the random choice between the two games, I will always choose the board game over the dice game. However, if I have played Pandemic quite a bit recently, there is a good chance I will chose the dice game in order to freshen up the experience.

It runs like this:

&amp;#x200B;

1 - Actively bad or broken. No-one's going to enjoy this.

2 - Poor. Avoid unless something in the theme or mechanics particularly appeals

3 - Good. Most gamers will have fun with this, unless it's in a genre they dislike.

4 - Great. Almost anyone will enjoy this.

5 - Outstanding. Widely appealling, innovative and addictive to play.

&amp;#x200B;

Almost no games get a 1: I think maybe 10 out of the 600 or so I've rated. More qualify for a 5 but they're still very rare, perhaps about 20.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this has been fine for me for a long time. But I suddenly realised that there's actually a fault line running through my 3\* games. Some of them are games I've held on to, and others I've let go. In the past, when I've thought about this, it's kind of the ""in a genre they dislike"" thing - they tend to be genres I dislike. But it made me wonder: from they point of view of the folk reading my reviews ... are they all really 3\*?

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example of where it's problematic. I only rated Azul 3\* because I'm not that on board with its abstract, low interaction nature. But it's staying on my shelf: it has wide appeal and it's challenging to play well. Nusfjord, on the other hand, is admirable for the way it slims down the challenge of point-salad games and it does the job well. But I simply don't find it engaging enough to keep improving.

&amp;#x200B;

It struck me that with 1\* being so barely used - and really, not that much different from 2\* in many ways (who's going to buy a game that gets a 2\* score?) - perhaps I should just amalgamate them and have ""good but not recommended"" games as 2\*. Or it could flip the other way: I could lighten up on 5\* criteria and push the ""keeper"" 3\* games into 5\*.

&amp;#x200B;

Or am I simply otherthinking this? I feel it's important because as we get lost in an ever-increasing sea of new releases, gamers need to get a clear idea of whether a game might appeal to them, and ratings are a useful stamp of clarity at the end of a review.

Hi! I'm looking for a game, all I have to go on is someones description of it, and even that description is a little fuzzy now.

It's sort of like Bandu in that there are a variety of pieces of different odd shapes, and you have to stack the pieces into a structure.

In the game that was described to me, there is another layer of complexity, I believe you sometimes switch your structure with other players, maybe pick the pieces other players are going to use...I don't remember any other specific rules but I remember being intrigued.

(Sorry for potato quality)


I've been delving pretty deeply into tabletop for the last 2-3 years now. I work in the world of esports, and throughout have had the opportunity to live in team houses. I figured ""Hey, I have ~20-40 housemates, why not always have offline games to play?""


For me personally, tabletop has really become a way to fill a social void. If you spend 8+ hours a day talking about how great video games are, you probably don't always want to go home and decompress with video games every night. Within the last two years especially, being able to invite a few people over, unplug, and create an immersively social experience has been vital to my relationships, work/life balance, and mental health.


I'm a bit of a completionist, so any game I get *really* into I want to make sure I have every expansion, accessory, and promo. I'm also a believer of ""One Box = One Game"", so I try to consolidate any title into its base game box whenever possible (Cosmic Encounter and T.I.M.E. Stories are two great examples of this being completely impossible). Sites like [Broken Token](https://www.thebrokentoken.com/) and [Top Shelf Gamer](https://www.topshelfgamer.com/) are frequents, always looking for component upgrades and organizers.


I try and keep my collection organized. The right two columns are cooperative titles, with the following two columns being competitive. Top/Left cell are small box cooperative titles, with competitive small box titles directly underneath. Beneath that are two solitaire titles that I've always been fascinated by. Here is **[my full](http://goo.gl/otKMBS)** visual list of games with expansions and promos.


Believe it or not, I have just completed my first real purge, trying to get to a point where any possible game someone pulls off the shelf to play is one I know will be a hit both personally and for the group. I absolutely love [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/profile/spiher), but often the games don't quite live up to the hype, so many are being removed.


My current five ""go-to"" games are [Splendor](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/148228/splendor), [Mansions of Madness](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/205059/mansions-madness-second-edition), Clank!, Mysterium, and [Century: Spice Road](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/209685/century-spice-road). These are the usual defaults, as they're all amazing games and easy to pick up. My three games I'm most interested in right now are [T.I.M.E.

I've got great friends who enjoy getting together to play and none of us are particularly competitive, but that groan when I win makes me feel guilty every time. What should I do about it?

I feel pretty bad in particular for my boyfriend - he's fully embraced my hobby since we started dating, and we play regularly, but he almost never gets to win. I have no idea how he can stay so enthusiastic about playing with me despite it - there's no way I'd take it so well in his position!

&amp;#x200B;

**Tryharding:**

I'm a fairly casual player but I do have a tendency to try really hard once someone's got me on the ropes - I love that competition! I've never thought of winning as particularly important to me, but reflecting on it I do think I fight really hard for the win if pushed. Is it important to chill out some more and just let things happen?

**Throwing Games:**

I've lost on purpose before if I know the other player won't take losing well - and I really hate doing it. It feels like an underhanded insult to them, and it sucks out a lot of the fun for me. Do you think it's worthwhile to deliberately lose? Personally I'd say no unless you're up against the tantrum loser or a really nervous first-time player.

**Teaching Strategy:**

I was looking around this subreddit to see if anyone had similar issues, and some advice someone posted was to aim to share strategy knowledge of the game as you play. This sounds pretty good when it comes to general strategy advice, which I tend to give out already - but should you basically explain to the other players what you're up to if they're falling behind?

&amp;#x200B;

This is a really hard question for me because a big part still wants to do everything I can to win. Ultimately, I just want everyone to be able to enjoy games like I do, and I don't want to get in the way of that - but I don't want to curb my own fun, either.

**TL;DR:** Winning most of the time. What should you do to either get other players to win more or have a better time?","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m that player in our group who wins most of the time, and I&amp;#39;m worried it&amp;#39;s stopping other people from enjoying the games as much as me. I&amp;#39;ve got great friends who enjoy getting together to play and none of us are particularly competitive, but that groan when I win makes me feel guilty every time. What should I do about it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel pretty bad in particular for my boyfriend - he&amp;#39;s fully embraced my hobby since we started dating, and we play regularly, but he almost never gets to win. I have no idea how he can stay so enthusiastic about playing with me despite it - there&amp;#39;s no way I&amp;#39;d take it so well in his position!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tryharding:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a fairly casual player but I do have a tendency to try really hard once someone&amp;#39;s got me on the ropes - I love that competition! I&amp;#39;ve never thought of winning as particularly important to me, but reflecting on it I do think I fight really hard for the win if pushed. Is it important to chill out some more and just let things happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throwing Games:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve lost on purpose before if I know the other player won&amp;#39;t take losing well - and I really hate doing it. It feels like an underhanded insult to them, and it sucks out a lot of the fun for me. Do you think it&amp;#39;s worthwhile to deliberately lose? Personally I&amp;#39;d say no unless you&amp;#39;re up against the tantrum loser or a really nervous first-time player.&lt;/p&gt;

At their core, both games are simple enough, but I recall seeing **Race** quoted as difficult to teach, whereas **Roll** is supposed to be a lighter alternative. Let me be clear, I'm not sure if this is a consensus or even an highly shared opinion. I think The Dice Tower mentioned this a few times, maybe that gave me the impression that the community had the same opinion. 

Anyway, I bring the subject because I always thought **Race** was the easier game to teach. It seems so much straightforward in comparison to me. 5 phases, each player simultaneously choose which to activate, and they're all pretty easy to teach by themselves. Then comes the iconography which some people blow out of proportion (usually, it's the main argument given when arguing that **Race** is a hassle to teach.) I don't get why though. There's barely any variety in the symbols used and the more esoteric ones have a textual explanation on the card itself.

On the other hand, I find that **Roll** is a bit harder to teach, not much but still. I guess I feel the dice assignment is less intuitive gameplay-wise than just selecting an action from your hand, i.e. selecting one main action with your dice and potentially other secondary actions compared to just choosing a card in your hand. Maybe I feel this way because I got the game taught to me initially by someone who struggles with rules teaching though.

There's a game a friend of mine had like 12 years ago. Fabric mat, disk magnets black on one side white on the other, mat has large circle.

The magnets were designed such that you could lay one flat and then ""lean"" magnets against the flat ones. If you had steady hands you could even lean magnets against other magnets. Eventually there are too many magnets on the board and someone disrupts the balance and a bunch of magnets connect. Your opponent takes the magnets that connect or leave the circle on your turn, and the number of magnets is your score to win.

I have a group of around 40 close friends that I invite every other week to a game night I host. I started collecting board games in May 2018 after I got my promotion at work. I’ve been buying a bunch of games that I see on Game the Game of Tabletop that I thought looked enjoyable. We’ve only had 3 game nights to this point but I noticed a small problem

We usually have too many people. Sometimes someone is sitting out. We have had attendance of 6, 9, 5 at game nights since we started hosting. The second night was difficult as I have games for that many people like Secret Hitler, Formula D, Tsuro (which we had the loser sit out but then someone said they were tired and went home so it worked out). 

I offered to split the group so that we had more diversity and I’d play two games at once that way I could help both groups with the rules but people didn’t seem to want to do that. Most of the games I have are for 5-6 players at most. 

So the big question here is, how do I get people who may want to split off into different groups to player smaller games so that we can have more diversity during game night. A lot of people, I feel, want to try a new game to sample what they like, but are afraid to mess up the rules. I also think that as people start to come “regularly” (I.e only 3 people have been to all 3 game nights so far) they will start to learn the games they like and then want to play those games instead.

Anyways looking for suggestions!

## What this is:

 This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

 All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

 Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that it was the rum, but, god damn is that a fun game. Unfortunately most of my friends are a little too shallow to get into something like this, but I can&amp;#39;t wait to look into some new ones and introduce friends (maybe meet new people) to them. I grew up in family that bonded around strategic card games, so this seems to fit just right.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m my regular group, this has gradually been getting worse with certain players, and I&amp;#39;m thinking about bringing it up. But I don&amp;#39;t just want to roll in saying &amp;#39;hey this is a problem&amp;#39; without having thought it through and maybe had having some compromises on hand. And I also don&amp;#39;t want to just call out a couple people because I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on in their lives, and I don&amp;#39;t want them to feel like they have to justify it if they need to take a call ore respond to a message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you all have any group rules for cell phone use during long or complicated games? How did you decide what rules to have? Do you have phone breaks for long games? Do you pause the game while people are on the phone? Would it be crazy to ask that phones be kept on vibrate? And is there a tactful way to bring this up with my usual group, or to ask about phone use when I&amp;#39;m being invited to play somewhere new, or to mention it when I&amp;#39;m having new people over to game?&lt;/p&gt;

This game is intended to be Kickstarted in October 2018, however the game is still undergoing some significant game-balance revision. I have permission from Alex at GFG to discuss the game (see [my BGG thread](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2052868/preview-beta-test-reavers-midgard) on the same), but I'm not going to post an exhaustive manual of the game in this space given its beta status (nor do I want to share anything approaching IP). I've seen enough to tell you what Reavers of Midgard (RoM) is, and I'll explain it by comparing it to other popular games, including its spiritual predecessor, Champions of Midgard (CoM).

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary of RoM**

*Players:* 2 to 5, but I think 4 players is the intended best? There is chatter of some solo rules, but nothing I've seen playtested

*Chief Mechanics:* Resource management (moderate), set completion, drafting, simple worker placement, synergy. There's not enough combat in the current version to justify that keyword, unlike CoM.

*Weight (BGG scale):* If Puerto Rico is a 3.29, and Terra Mystica is a 3.95, then the current incarnation of RoM is about a 3.4 to 3.5. Yes, that's significantly heavier than CoM's 2.53.

*Describe RoM in a tweet:* Recruit Reaver cards and warrior dice, then deploy them to conquer territories, raid keeps, and battle at sea! Collect special abilities to improve your strategy, and sets of rewards for increasing Glory!

&amp;#x200B;

**The ""Feel"" of Playing RoM**

Like CoM, the theme of RoM is of competing Viking bands who enrich themselves and defend the homeland from threats. The playtest version of course didn't have the assistance of art to capture the theme of the actions, but the result is that, when you declare a Battle action or a Recruit action or a Trade, everyone participates if they are able, but as the leader of that action you will get the choicest spoils, and your peers that are ill-equipped to join you on your exploits won't get their share.

&amp;#x200B;

RoM is technically a ""worker placement"" game, but the phrase is more true of CoM than this one; you get one worker, and you are essentially choosing one of six locations on the board. You'll be first to complete the actions instructed and nab the resources there, but then the other players will take the same action, in order, with diminishing returns. In this respect, the game mimics **Puerto Rico's** phase drafting, but represents it with worker placement on the board. However, opponents that do not have the required resources cannot participate in the same action, so plotting certain actions while your opponent is unable to share in the gains is strategically necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll spend the game ultimately trying to acquire victory points (""Glory""), some of which are scored immediately, and some of which are tallied at the end of the game. To do so, you will acquire other resources that you will spend to gain said Glory. Some resources are simple, such as food, which is required to participate in some actions such as Raiding Keeps. Some resources are complex, such as the Reaver cards and the warrior dice that you draft. There are six locations on the board, and all of them involve gaining resources and/or cards and dice.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example board location, the ""Raid Keeps"" action, which has the following steps:

1. Spend 3 food and 2 shield dice
2. Draft a column of Spoils cards
3. Draw bonus Spoils cards (2/1/0/0/0)

&amp;#x200B;

Being your action during the Turn, you place your worker on the Raid Keeps location. You spend the food and dice required, then you choose one of three vertical columns of Spoils cards to take. Let's say you see one card with a matching icon to one you've already collected, so you draft that column for increasingly larger set completion bonuses. Finally, you draw two bonus Spoils cards from the top of the deck.

&amp;#x200B;

Your opponent to your left doesn't have enough food or dice to participate (which you knew), so she must ""pass"", instead drafting one warrior die of her choice. The next opponent does spend the food and dice, and drafts one of the remaining columns of Spoils cards. He then draws 1 bonus Spoils card as shown by the numbers in the slashes. The last opponent in a four-player game also spends the food and dice, opts for a single Spoils card from the deck (an alternative to the remaining column of Spoils cards), and then gets no bonus cards as shown by the slash numbers. This ends your action and the player on your left now places their worker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Warrior Dice, Reavers, and Comparisons to CoM**

In CoM, the primary mechanic is the warrior dice, which are worth nothing at the end of the game, but are committed to battle in order to (hopefully) defeat monsters for glory, set bonuses, and more resources and dice.

&amp;#x200B;

In RoM, dice behave differently: you roll the dice when *drafted*, not in combat. The faceup side of the die defines that warrior's role or particular training; you need Shield dice or Boat dice or Hammer dice, etc. to complete certain actions. The colors of the dice pertain to the possible outcomes of the die when you draft and roll it (i.e. blue dice can't roll Shields, but are the only dice to roll Trees). You simply spend dice as required, although occasionally you may be permitted to reroll one or more dice.

&amp;#x200B;

The primary mechanic in RoM are the namesake Reaver cards, which are like lieutenants for your warriors. These are gained via the Recruit Reavers action. When you draft a Reaver card, you gain several warrior dice as well, and this is the chief method to gain dice in the game. With this Reaver card, you can use it in three ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You can discard it to your endgame pile. Doing so provides you with bonus warrior dice indicated by the card.
2. You can place it in the leader side of your boat, the large card where you organize your resources and abilities. This bumps the former Reaver card into your endgame pile. The color of the Reaver indicates that dice *of that color* you possess are now ""wild"" and can be spent as any symbol on the die in certain circumstances. You also gain one of three rewards each time you promote a new Reaver, so you may prefer that benefit to the dice gained by discarding it.
3. Instead of the above, you can assign the Reaver to one of several ""engines"" at the bottom of your boat, which correspond to certain board actions, such as Raid Keeps. Whenever you complete the corresponding action, each Reaver card triggers a unique benefit printed on the card (for example, ""Draw a free Spoils card"").

&amp;#x200B;

**Maybe Not Heavy, Just Complex**

RoM isn't the kind of ""heavy"" where it overwhelms the player with myriad possible actions. Instead, RoM is the kind of game where it may not always be clear what the most profitable rewards are. Whereas in CoM the monsters were worth a static amount of points on the card plus a bonus for color sets, a reward set in RoM could be worth, say 1/3/6/10/15. So gaining a fifth card of the matching type is worth five points, but the sixth is worth only one point as you're starting a new set. While resources are worth little or no points after the game, it can be difficult determining which cards on the board may be ""worth"" the most to you. I'm not sure if its intentionally a complicated flux or marketplace, or my own inexperience with a game still under construction. It could also be a playtesting competition, to see which rewards players most enjoy to seek.

&amp;#x200B;

Many games choose to narrow the options to thematically and tactically reduce viable strategies, as well as shorten the game and force a resolution; instead, RoM seems to invite a large number of hybrid tactics and perhaps prevent competitive stymies. While in CoM you can take the best of two sources of a resource on the board, in Reavers there seems to be three ways to get every kind of resource, except the Reavers cards themselves and the static Sea Battle cards. Likewise, you're never swimming in resources (unless you do it intentionally), and you don't have to resource to accounting practices to track them.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's my assumption that RoM is intended to be a less directly-competitive, more ""personal sandbox"" style of worker placement/resource management game. This is one of the few games where it would take a concerted effort by the other players to keep you from getting something you clearly want; you're mostly likely to be stymied be others merely taking the card you want or the action you wanted or weren't prepared for. RoM seems a good game for those who might want to dabble in the marketplace at hand, reacting to the choices of other players and choosing simple strategies; however, players who successfully execute engine-building strategies and exploit special abilities will consistently outperform those players.

&amp;#x200B;

(This incarnation of) Reavers of Midgard is more of a Euro-style point-grab than its predecessor, with fewer ways to thwart your opponents' tactics than most. If you're looking for a points-race game where opponents can't perpetually trip each other up, then watch for this game to be Kickstarted in October.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a non-spoiler preview of the upcoming game from Grey Fox Games, &amp;quot;Reavers of Midgard&amp;quot;.

What I took from the game was:

* If I was to explain the game to a new group again, I would definately recomend a short tutorial (https://youtu.be/MrmFWOm6U0g is a great balance between duration and depth).

* Popularity is important, but not the only factor in winning. I managed to get up to 17 popularity, but as I did not have a large amount of territories I only managed a middle of the pack score.

* Coins can be important. The winning player chose the factory card which generates 3 coins, and then spammed the move. He ended up with 27 coins at the end of the game, which gave him the win by 10ish coins.

* You dont always have to win combat. Again the winning player spread out his units to control a large amount of territories, then once he was setup, used a tunnel to begin combat with the player who was closest to 5 stars. He then bid 0 combat power, giving the white player a star, and then the white player ended the game on their next go by placing their 4th building.

While I was there one of the guys had a game and I want to know the name so I can buy it and play it again.

Here are the few things I can remember about how it was played so.

It started with tiles in which you randomly placed to make a ""game board"" you then had multiple monsters that were made out of like cardboard that you added to a little plastic stand for them. And you placed them on the board that you made (anywhere if I remember correctly) then you had cards matching the monsters and you each drew a card (maybe 3 I think) and they matched monsters on the board but the other players didn't know who you had and then you each took turns moving the monsters one space at a time and if they met on the same square tile that monster ""died"" and was set aside untill only one was left and the goal was to try and keep the monster that matched your card alive till the end and then that person got the points for that round. Once someone won you could choose to move the tiles around to make a different looking map or ""game board"" also turn the cards back in and shuffle and grab new card. 

Few more details was I think the tiles that made up the game board were two sided. The tiles were also like some sort of dungeon. 2 players were the least but I know that when we played it we had 4 players I'm not sure if any more than that could play but I don't remember. 

I appreciate all the help anyone can give me THANKS!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So about 3 years or so ago I met up with some old friends from high school which I can no longer get ahold of. While I was there one of the guys had a game and I want to know the name so I can buy it and play it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the few things I can remember about how it was played so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with tiles in which you randomly placed to make a &amp;quot;game board&amp;quot; you then had multiple monsters that were made out of like cardboard that you added to a little plastic stand for them. And you placed them on the board that you made (anywhere if I remember correctly) then you had cards matching the monsters and you each drew a card (maybe 3 I think) and they matched monsters on the board but the other players didn&amp;#39;t know who you had and then you each took turns moving the monsters one space at a time and if they met on the same square tile that monster &amp;quot;died&amp;quot; and was set aside untill only one was left and the goal was to try and keep the monster that matched your card alive till the end and then that person got the points for that round. Once someone won you could choose to move the tiles around to make a different looking map or &amp;quot;game board&amp;quot; also turn the cards back in and shuffle and grab new card. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few more details was I think the tiles that made up the game board were two sided. The tiles were also like some sort of dungeon. 2 players were the least but I know that when we played it we had 4 players I&amp;#39;m not sure if any more than that could play but I don&amp;#39;t remember. &lt;/p&gt;

Ok, so my turn 1: I get clank+2 and so I put my clank in the clank area but not in the bag.
Dragon attack: so now my clanks get put in the bag. That is clear.

Alternative turn 1: I get clank+1 and a clank -2 so I dont get to carry the extra -1 because the rules say you lose any unused -clanks at the end of you turn. Nothing goes in the area. That is clear too.

But, let's say turn 1: +2 clank. They go in the clank area but not in the bag as I've not had a dragon attack yet.
My Turn 2: I get -1 clank but don't generate any clank on that turn, can I use that -1 clank to get one of the clanks back from the clank area? It's not got in the bag yet as there hasn't been a dragon attack, and I'm not carrying my -clank over to the next go.

Don't think it changes the game hugely but I just had one of those ""shit, I wonder if I've been playing it wrong this whole time"" moments. It's not even a complicated book but I've lost the rulebook a while ago and only now started wondering!

Worst for me is from the review of Tom Vasel I bought First and Goal.  I'm a huge football and haven't found many games that work with that theme and aren't super bogged down simulations.  So I picked this up on his review.  It was pretty boring, just chucking dice with very very little thinking.  It was also anti thematic as breaking normal football tendencies is way more powerful than it actually should be making this into a guess fest.  

Best is also from Tom Vasel and it is New York Pizza Slice.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; Daily Discussion and Game Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

I have spent quite a bit on Kickstarter in the last five years, something to the tune of $6000 or $7000 over 169 projects. 

Just to be clear, this was all disposable income, so it didn't hurt me in any way. About 90% was on board games, the rest on tech and comics/graphic novels.

Looking over Starcadia Quest, I just felt plain old nothing. Not one ounce of me wanted to drop $120 on the ""base pledge"", i.e. the one that you really should get, since it comes with SO MUCH MORE COOL STUFF than the $80 actual base pledge. I already have retail Arcadia Quest and Inferno with all the goodies, now you want me to buy MORE???

I have so many games (\~200), and to be honest, my all time favorite games have almost never come from Kickstarter. What games do I rate a 9 or a 10? Games like Agricola/Caverna, Pandemic, Descent 2.0, Stone Age, Dominion, T'Zolkin, Glory to Rome, 7 Wonders: Duels, LOTR: LCG,  

I should note the few games that I have received from Kickstarter and were fantasic. Stonemeier Games really does come through, I'm almost sad Jamie has given up Kickstarter. I love Viticulture with Tuscany, Euphoria (for all of it's flaws), and Scythe. Between Two Cities is good, though not in the same tier as the three I mentioned.

King's Forge,  Eminent Domain, Evolution, Through the Ages (2nd Edition), Myth: Dark Frontier,  were also totally worth the purchase and the wait. The other 135ish board games? Honestly, I could probably do without them.

The issue might of course be me...I have a family, a toddler, two older kids that love playing games with me, but at 9 and 13 they can only do so much with the time we have together (every other weekend and one weeknight). When I do get together for games, it's not a 3 hour epic.

And yet, I purchased quite a few games that maybe I didn't need. Heck, I just backed Death May Die because I love the Mythos and things Cthulu.

I'm curious if anyone shares my current dislike of too much plastic on Kickstarter, if you find yourself buying games you might end up never playing, or if you just want to share your favorite games from Kickstarter.

Also, take away the lesson that Kickstarter will very rarely leave you content. There is ALWAYS something more to buy. There is ALWAYS another project with Kickstarter exclusives. I don't object to Kiskstarter as a whole, but at the end of the day it will work out in your favor to just wait for things to come to retail and be reviewed.

&amp;#x200B;

You know how many games CMON has put out that are critcally acclaimed? My anecdotal experience says just one: Blood Rage. The rest are just recycled dice chuckers with a ton of plastic to get you to buy. 

&amp;#x200B;

FYI, the big plastic games I have backed are:

&amp;#x200B;

Myth

Myth: Journeyman

Conan

Batman: Gotham City Chronicles

Arcadia Quest: Inferno

Rising Sun (Sold at cost)

Massive Darkness (Sold at cost)

Zombicide: Black Plague

Zombicide: Green Horde

Sword &amp; Sorcery

The Banner Saga: Warband

Dark Souls

Mythic Battles: Pantehon

Cthulu: Death May Die

&amp;#x200B;

You might count Scythe, Dungeons of Arcadia: Masmorra, Myth: Dark Frontier, Gloomhaven (enourmous, though not much plastic inside), if you feel so inclined.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a long look at the Starcadia Quest page, and came to the realization that I think I am just about done with backing board games with a huge amount of plastic on Kickstarter and cost over $100.

Ordered through Amazon from Amazon. Best option?**


I purchased Spirit Island through Amazon (initially thought GTG was the seller) and, after several plays, noticed a [misprinted card](https://imgur.com/a/t9DPd5n). 

If it wasn't an invader card it wouldn't be a big deal, but now I know those invaders want my sands and mountains and my poor, beautiful Dahan. I love my Dahan. Of course, I'm going to preempt that exploration if I can keep all of the moves straight in my head.

So, this card hasn't actually come up yet. I've only played the base difficulty and my friend and I typically take things down right before the level 3 invaders, but I know it's coming at some point. Per some other thread, I've emailed craig@greaterthangames with no reply yet (it's only been 5 days). 

* Will they replace the card? 
* Should I just return the whole thing to Amazon and order a new one even though this one has been played a few times?
* Is Branch and Claw that divisive?
* What's your favorite spirit from the base game?

These are the questions rattling in my mind. Unending. Dramatically. Invaderously.

To be clear, I'm using ""casual"" tournament to distinguish from something like the national Catan tournament at Origins.  A casual tournament is played entirely at a single convention. There are no qualifiers, so anyone who knows the rules to the game can play since the rules won't be taught. Games are usually spread out across the duration of the con, and joining a game does not require you to commit to any more games; you can play in just one round if you want.  Casual tournament games are usually listed in the event list alongside all the other scheduled games, but with a designation that this game counts for tournament scoring.  After all rounds have finished, the players with the highest win count are invited back for the semis/finals, and the final winner might get a plaque or something. No title, no status.  If you've ever been to WBC, this is the kind of tournament I'm talking about.

Having been to a few conventions with this tournament structure, it seems that different attendees have different reasons for signing up or not signing up for these tournament games. Some people say they don't like the ""tournament"" designation.  Some people like the competitive aspect, while others don't even care and just show up because it's on the schedule.  Others don't like scheduled games at all and prefer open gaming.  There seem to be many different expectations and assumptions for what these games are like.

So, what I'm curious to know is how this community feels about these kinds of games, whether you play in them or not.  If you've never heard of this before, consider- how would you feel about playing a familiar game at a convention knowing that it counted for a tournament and people are probably playing to win?  As mentioned earlier, playing in this game in no way forces you to participate in other tournament games.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who both attends conventions and sometimes runs them, I&amp;#39;m trying to get a better understanding for why some people join games that are part of casual tournaments and why others shy away.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm more talking about the practice of doing it, and whether there is money to be made / opinions about the ethics of doing so.

I recently received Zombicide: Green Horde and paid a total of $150 CAD after taxes and shipping.  When I received it, I was at a point where I really wanted to buy Twilight Imperium and/or Gloomhaven.  Looking at the prospect of a $400 investment for those 2 games, something had to go.  I turned around and sold the unopened Green Horde box for $260.  

I almost doubled my money for literally doing nothing. That kind of return on any investment is pretty staggering.  That being said, the game, like most kickstarters, took about a year to receive, so it was a bit of an investment.  

Now I'm wondering if this is worth doing in bulk.  There's an obvious risk to a game not being delivered, being delayed, or not being as good as expected.  But if you only invested in bigger companies' games like CMON it's a pretty surefire thing. 

I did some research into CMON games specifically and I see that Rising Sun lots have sold for over $400 for only a $100 investment.  Song Song of Ice and Fire The Miniatures Game lots have sold for $600+ for a $200 investment.

And the couple of times I did try, it was very energetic with lots of table talk, making it for a very fun game night.

So, I'm extremely happy to see that they are reprinting it (with some improvements). It's a bit unfortunate that it doesn't have the Discworld theme as I'm a huge fan of Sir Pratchett's work, but the gameplay alone was great for us, so I'm really looking forward to it.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance – oh, and win the game.

In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.

Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:


    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.
    Draw a card from any regular deck – This can be chosen only once by each player.
    Visit the opera and spend $2.
    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.
    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.


Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses – of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! – to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.

At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.

If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.

*Favorite games of your collection*

Mine are:

**Twilight Imperium** - great for 6 more serious games, this is the most epic game Ive played!

**Cosmic Encounter** - screams with replayability, promotes laughter.

**Whitehall Mystery** - when played with 4, this is coop at its finest.  Tense with lots of giggles and snickering.

**878 Vikings** - it's a 2v2 light war game... What more must I say?

Party games:

**Monikers** - tonnes of fun

**Telestrations** - drawings lost in translation... It's a blast

**Secret Hitler** - very deceptive and devious this game is great!


###The Bad
*Least favorite/games shunned to the depths of hell of your collection*

Mine are:

**Dead of Winter** - felt more like a gruelling chore than a game

**Pandemic** - too alphagamer/quarterbacking prone

**Risk 2210AD** - too reliant on the dice roll... After a 7 hour game we never want to play again when other much better games can we played

**Cards Against Humanity** - novelty aside, it's not particularly fun playing prewritten cards to prewritten prompts.  Monikers and Telestrations decimate this game.

**Coup** - this is a game which needs everyone to ""get it""... I dunno it fell flat :(

**Exploding Kittens** - just not very fun.  Sort of avoids any highs or any lows.

###The Ugly
*Unplayed games of your collection*

Mine are:

**Mafia de Cuba** - for next time I have a large group over

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - likewise

**New Angeles** - 6 players is tough... For a whole day and beyond it's TI4, beyond that it's very difficult to decide between staying at 6 or bumping up to party games (especially with Deception and de Cuba to be played).  A longer more complex game, it isn't one to start when people begin leaving either.  I do seriously want to set a day around this game though!  It looks amazing!

**Battle For Rokugan** - when I want to play a game with 5 players that isn't **Cosmic Encounter** or **Mysterium** or even **New Angeles**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twilight Imperium&lt;/strong&gt; - great for 6 more serious games, this is the most epic game Ive played!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/strong&gt; - screams with replayability, promotes laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whitehall Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; - when played with 4, this is coop at its finest.  Tense with lots of giggles and snickering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;878 Vikings&lt;/strong&gt; - it&amp;#39;s a 2v2 light war game... What more must I say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Party games:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monikers&lt;/strong&gt; - tonnes of fun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telestrations&lt;/strong&gt; - drawings lost in translation... It&amp;#39;s a blast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret Hitler&lt;/strong&gt; - very deceptive and devious this game is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Least favorite/games shunned to the depths of hell of your collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead of Winter&lt;/strong&gt; - felt more like a gruelling chore than a game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; - too alphagamer/quarterbacking prone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk 2210AD&lt;/strong&gt; - too reliant on the dice roll... After a 7 hour game we never want to play again when other much better games can we played&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cards Against Humanity&lt;/strong&gt; - novelty aside, it&amp;#39;s not particularly fun playing prewritten cards to prewritten prompts.  Monikers and Telestrations decimate this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coup&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a game which needs everyone to &amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;... I dunno it fell flat :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploding Kittens&lt;/strong&gt; - just not very fun.  Sort of avoids any highs or any lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unplayed games of your collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mafia de Cuba&lt;/strong&gt; - for next time I have a large group over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception: Murder in Hong Kong&lt;/strong&gt; - likewise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Angeles&lt;/strong&gt; - 6 players is tough... For a whole day and beyond it&amp;#39;s TI4, beyond that it&amp;#39;s very difficult to decide between staying at 6 or bumping up to party games (especially with Deception and de Cuba to be played).  A longer more complex game, it isn&amp;#39;t one to start when people begin leaving either.  I do seriously want to set a day around this game though!  It looks amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle For Rokugan&lt;/strong&gt; - when I want to play a game with 5 players that isn&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Mysterium&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;New Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Can you move the Raven to a location, to have it perform an action (say, to get 3 Power) then move Maleficent to that same location, then perform that same action?

We ask because it could be seen as Maleficent's turn, and therefore she only gets to perform each action at a location once. Or, the Raven gets to perform an action independent of Maleficent's action ""phase,"" because it's at the start of her turn, and therefore she doesn't ""use up"" that action at that location.

Thank you for the clarification!

This is relevant part of the email:

# Rule Changes: Intellectual Property

After discussing some challenging rulings lately, we've decided to clarify our stance on intellectual property and reproducibility:

&gt;*Out of respect for designers and publishers in our hobby,* we do not allow any posts that enable a full or significant reproduction/recreation of any game

* Effectively you can share pics of your retheme in play, but not any of the raw images or files you used to make it
* This is not a legality judgment, and will stand even if the images are  public domain or ""fair use"". Legal protections for game concepts and mechanisms are actually notoriously weak or nonexistent, hence one of the reasons the community tries to be self-policing about copying ideas without permission.
* Offering or suggesting to provide files via PM or commenting on such posts asking for files is also clearly not in the spirit of the rule.
* We *may* allow reproducible materials when there's clear approval from the designer/publisher. *However* verifying this approval can be a tedious task for us, so ask first and assume that we're not going to allow it.

&gt;Issues with copyright and other intellectual property violations should be handled through Reddit's [official channels](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement#text-content8).

* Assuming the post follows the reproducibility rule, we're not going to try to determine if there are any other IP infringements, i.e. in the case of a retheme using characters or content from a book, movie, TV show, or video game. The mod team is simply unequipped to evaluate legitimacy and reddit already has full procedures and mechanisms for handling such problems.
   * Of couse we still reserve the right to intervene if something seems ""obviously"" wrong or objectively bad for the sub, though these scenarios are likely to trip other rules.

# Rule Changes: Promotional Posts

Continuing from the discussion in our [last town hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/95wznh/rboardgames_town_hall_august_2018/), we will be implementing our revisions to promo rules as follows:

&gt;r/boardgames is a community, not an audience. Our rules are designed to promote community engagement, rather than being purely a conduit to promote a blog, podcast, Kickstarter, YouTube channel, or similar. In order to ensure this is maintained, /r/boardgames limits promotional posts or activities for which one could receive a financial benefit to these guidelines:  
&gt;  
&gt;**No more than one post per-user, per-week (7 days) from a single source.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Multiple posts linking the same source require a 10:1 ratio (or greater) of comments between posts.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Sitewide Reddit karma must be above 100 to share links.**  
&gt;  
&gt;However, sharing content should hopefully not be your primary interaction with /r/boardgames, just as dominating a conversation would not be acceptable in other social engagements. Reddit sitewide guidelines suggest only 10 percent of all your activity should be about your own products. We support similar expectations. r/boardgames is a community, an opportunity for conversation with others who share a similar passion, not an audience.

This is the same basic idea we presented then—to loosen the restrictions on users who are posting from a variety of sources, while compensating with a small karma barrier to limit spam—but slightly revised to handle a few perceived weaknesses. Note that, aside from sub-100-karma accounts, all posts complying with the old rules would still be valid under the new ones.

It may take a little bit for us to get all of our ducks in a row, but we're going to start transitioning to using this guideline immediately.

# Upcoming User Flair Changes and Voting

First of all, **we'll be holding a flair suggestion + voting thread next week,** so get your ideas churning. However things will be a little different this time around:

* **Switching to ""redesign-style"" flairs:** Old reddit implements flair icons with CSS hacks, new reddit supports them as *emoji.* With this flair update we'll be transitioning some-to-most flairs to the new system. This **isn't** a statement that we're throwing our weight behind the redesign in general. The emoji are backwards-compatible, whereas the CSS *isn't* forwards-compatible, so using redesign for this gives us the best overall support. The new system also gives us built-in controls (instead of a 3rd-party script a select few can run) and higher-quality images.
* **Flair count limits:** Our tool previously limited us to 350 flair slots, while new reddit is limited to 300 emojis. However, based on what reddit devs have said publicly, we do expect the limit to be relaxed in the near future. For now, I'm going to cap us at 280 game flairs so that we have a few slots for generic icons and experimentation. For now we'll still use the 350 limit as the threshold for ""bumping off"" old flairs. At the time of the vote thread, I'll post a table of all the least-used flairs that are on or near the chopping block. Note that in the past, we've had vehement fans of low-usage flairs successfully rally and save them from the purge.
* **Resolution upgrade:** Emoji can be uploaded at resolutions up to 128x128px. Even though our flair displays at 16x16 in *CSS pixels*, on many devices with higher *pixel density* you will see a higher-resolution image. For example, my computer sees the revised and old Agricola flairs as below.
   * We do have permission from BGG admins (thanks BGG!) to continue to use their microbadges in our flair system. However their badges are limited to exactly 16x16, so if folks are interested in helping to upgrade, we'll have to coordinate the creation of new images, as well as permission to use the corresponding source material. I'll have more details on this later.

We also have some visual tweaks available on new reddit, like choosing the background color for default flairs (just this week they added a transparent option, too) or upping the flair size. I personally think having larger-than-text-size looks clunky, but on the other hand, it could enable us to use some images that were previously too small to be recognizable.

# Subreddit History Mystery

/r/boardgames **is coming up on its 10th anniversary in a little over a week!** In celebration, we've been exploring our archives and finding some interesting historical posts, #modsarenerds, but there's one glaring omission in our discoveries: *who actually created the subreddit?* Nowadays reddit records the original creator of each sub, but this wasn't true in 2008. Reddit duplicators and generic web history tools don't reach back far enough and only reveal more mysteries. For example, the first post that didn't later get deleted wasn't submitted until 11 months in, but by then there was already a team of several mods?

We're **not** looking for you to message users for us. We've already reached out to a number of folks, and we don't want anyone swarmed with inquiries. It's probably annoying enough when *one* internet stranger asks what you were doing a decade ago! We are looking for either: people who were around in the old days and have any clues or interesting details about the early sub, *or* suggestions of other techniques we can explore.

This isn't high stakes, just looking for some fun trivia as we approach year 11 and several other milestones. *\*cough\** 1 million users *\*cough\** top 100 sub *\*cough\**

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;h1&gt;Upcoming User Flair Changes and Voting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;we&amp;#39;ll be holding a flair suggestion + voting thread next week,&lt;/strong&gt; so get your ideas churning. However things will be a little different this time around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching to &amp;quot;redesign-style&amp;quot; flairs:&lt;/strong&gt; Old reddit implements flair icons with CSS hacks, new reddit supports them as &lt;em&gt;emoji.&lt;/em&gt; With this flair update we&amp;#39;ll be transitioning some-to-most flairs to the new system. This &lt;strong&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; a statement that we&amp;#39;re throwing our weight behind the redesign in general. The emoji are backwards-compatible, whereas the CSS &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; forwards-compatible, so using redesign for this gives us the best overall support. The new system also gives us built-in controls (instead of a 3rd-party script a select few can run) and higher-quality images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flair count limits:&lt;/strong&gt; Our tool previously limited us to 350 flair slots, while new reddit is limited to 300 emojis. However, based on what reddit devs have said publicly, we do expect the limit to be relaxed in the near future. For now, I&amp;#39;m going to cap us at 280 game flairs so that we have a few slots for generic icons and experimentation. For now we&amp;#39;ll still use the 350 limit as the threshold for &amp;quot;bumping off&amp;quot; old flairs. At the time of the vote thread, I&amp;#39;ll post a table of all the least-used flairs that are on or near the chopping block. Note that in the past, we&amp;#39;ve had vehement fans of low-usage flairs successfully rally and save them from the purge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution upgrade:&lt;/strong&gt; Emoji can be uploaded at resolutions up to 128x128px. Even though our flair displays at 16x16 in &lt;em&gt;CSS pixels&lt;/em&gt;, on many devices with higher &lt;em&gt;pixel density&lt;/em&gt; you will see a higher-resolution image. For example, my computer sees the revised and old Agricola flairs as below.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do have permission from BGG admins (thanks BGG!) to continue to use their microbadges in our flair system. However their badges are limited to exactly 16x16, so if folks are interested in helping to upgrade, we&amp;#39;ll have to coordinate the creation of new images, as well as permission to use the corresponding source material. I&amp;#39;ll have more details on this later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have some visual tweaks available on new reddit, like choosing the background color for default flairs (just this week they added a transparent option, too) or upping the flair size. I personally think having larger-than-text-size looks clunky, but on the other hand, it could enable us to use some images that were previously too small to be recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Subreddit History Mystery&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is coming up on its 10th anniversary in a little over a week!&lt;/strong&gt; In celebration, we&amp;#39;ve been exploring our archives and finding some interesting historical posts, #modsarenerds, but there&amp;#39;s one glaring omission in our discoveries: &lt;em&gt;who actually created the subreddit?&lt;/em&gt; Nowadays reddit records the original creator of each sub, but this wasn&amp;#39;t true in 2008. Reddit duplicators and generic web history tools don&amp;#39;t reach back far enough and only reveal more mysteries. For example, the first post that didn&amp;#39;t later get deleted wasn&amp;#39;t submitted until 11 months in, but by then there was already a team of several mods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; looking for you to message users for us. We&amp;#39;ve already reached out to a number of folks, and we don&amp;#39;t want anyone swarmed with inquiries. It&amp;#39;s probably annoying enough when &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; internet stranger asks what you were doing a decade ago! We are looking for either: people who were around in the old days and have any clues or interesting details about the early sub, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; suggestions of other techniques we can explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t high stakes, just looking for some fun trivia as we approach year 11 and several other milestones. &lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;cough** 1 million users &lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;cough** top 100 sub &lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;cough**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew; that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ve got right now. Let us know your thoughts, and again, you&amp;#39;re welcome to discuss any topics here. Game on!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, everyone. I'm Cole Wehrle. I'm a former academic and now a staff designer and developer at Leder Games in Saint Paul. My brother Drew works at the Chicago Botanic Gardens. Together, we've decided to publish a new edition of Pax Pamir using Kickstarter.

We're here to answer any questions you might have about the new edition of Pax Pamir and it's development. We're also happy to talk about what it's like to work with a close friend and family member, and the experience of trying to start a business in your spare time. I'll be happy to chat about my previous games too, including Root.

And, of course, this is an AMA, so feel free to ask us about anything you'd like. We gab about music and movies and podcasts and books most days anyway, this time it'll just be in public!

I have a solid outline of a plan written up  (with Cole) for how to proceed and I am pleased with how many places we  can impact with expansion.

We DON'T use any of the monster figures, so I'm not concerned with their storage at all, because each of them will be staying in the original box for their game/expansion.

I'm trying to find a single chest with multiple compartments or slots for all the different tiles and chits and tokens and cards.  Preferably something somewhat portable.

I absolutely love the semi-cooperative feel to it, and the remarkably cohesive theme. Specifically:

 * The semi-cooperative portion is multi-faceted. The most common scenario has people all working on the dike for their own benefit, but hoping that it fails, meaning that people ask players with few cards or the wrong resource to help. However, very frequently, a couple people get screwed by the dike early in the game, and begin to work collaboratively to ensure it holds through the end of the game.

 * No one strategy is all-powerful. Often with such light games there's one strategy that will consistently be the best from game to game. This is not the case for Lowlands. The shifting scores, the amount of water coming in, the tiles that come up all affect which strategy is optimal. Sheep will never not be valuable, but they can add up to very few points in a dike-failing game.

 * Lowlands is a long, polynomial equation where the winner is the person with the most points, where every variable is how good of a decision the player made at a certain time, and each coefficient reflects how important that decision was. I very rarely find this type of complexity from a game this short.

 * It's short. Strictly speaking, I prefer a lot of the complexity and mechanics of Great Western Trail or Food Chain Magnate over this game, but this game (and setup) lasting no more than an hour with people who've played before means that it gets to the table more than any other game. You can comfortably play it several times in a night.

 * It's just plain fun. The times people have started yelling when they realize that the dike didn't break, and all of a sudden their hard-earned dike points are worthless, or their sheep aren't going to drown, or they get to throw away their dike tokens are some of my favorite moments in boardgaming. I love GWT, and AFFO, but this game forces you to look up, to engage other players, to pay attention to who's doing what, what the dike looks like, how people are spending their resources, who's going to work on the dike, what resource they're going to invest...not since archipelago have I enjoyed playing WITH others so much, instead of playing in parallel with someone, with their decisions not impacting me greatly.

Have you ever thought about how you can improve the experience for a visually impaired player? Paying attention to a few simple things can go a long way in improving the overall experience for a blind player. 

## Introduction

In the past couple of months, I have been mostly talking about visual accessibility in board games and providing some simple ideas to work around issues blind players may encounter with certain games. In this post, I want to talk about how sighted players can make the whole experience much more pleasant for the visually impaired and make them feel more engaged.

This post will consist of a few things sighted players should know when inviting their visually impaired or blind friends to play. 

## Choosing a Game

Let's start with the basics. When you invite people over, you either inform them of what you will play when organizing the meet up, or you will all decide when everyone arrives and starts pointing at different games on your shelf. Inviting a blind or visually impaired friend, however, requires some more thought as choosing a game that is barely playable and inaccessible may ruin the fun for everyone.

If you are introducing your friend to the hobby, you should narrow down your choices to gateway games. You may be tempted to play something more advanced if everyone else in your group is more experienced, but introducing a visually impaired player to a game like _Istanbul_ or _Power Grid_ may be overwhelming. Technically, this also applies for new sighted players, but the ability to see can speed things up when learning a new game for the first time. 

On the other hand, if the blind player has prior experience, make sure to ask them about the games they've played and enjoyed. You may not own those games, but it will be helpful in narrowing down the choices.

Next, you need to consider one of the biggest visual accessibility problems: hidden information. You probably do not own any Braille conversion kits or do not want to mark your cards with stickers, so if possible try to avoid those games. Cooperative games usually have no hidden information, so that is a good place to start. Games like _Forbidden Island / Forbidden Desert_, _Pandemic_ or _Burgle Bros._ fall into this category. 

There also are competitive games with no hidden information. Some examples are _King of Tokyo / King of New York_, _Camel Up_, or _No Thanks!_. Other good alternatives for intermediate players can be _Dice Forge_ or _Grand Austria Hotel_. This does not mean that games with hidden information are off limits, but they usually require some kind of modifications or visual aids to be playable.

Another thing to be aware of when choosing a game is the size and shape of the components. Blind people can distinguish two different components by touch, so it is important to have different size or shape for different types of resources. As  an example, _Camel Up_ has different sizes for each denomination of the money. One Egyptian Pound is a small cardboard coin, 5 Egyptian Pounds is a slightly larger coin, 10 Egyptian Pounds is a card etc. Now, imagine if all of the denominations were the same and the only way to distinguish them was just by reading the numbers. At the end of the game, when everyone counts their own money to see who the winner is, the blind player would need to sit there and wait for someone else to do it for them.

To summarize, the main goal is to engage the blind player as much as possible, so it is a good idea to spend some thought when choosing a game to play. The less downtime the blind player has, the better the experience for everyone involved should be.

## Setting Up and Tearing Down

Usually, these parts are considered to be the most boring parts in the game. However, if everyone is tasked to do something, it can both be faster and more entertaining than just sitting there and waiting for the host to set up everything.

Blind and visually impaired players are at a disadvantage here as there are some things that they are not able to do or it simply takes longer for them to do. This does not mean that you should completely ignore them during these two stages of the game. A blind player can still shuffle cards, deal cards or other types of resources, count components and store components in plastic bags.

For instance, they may not be able to remove the _Epidemic_ cards from the player card deck in _Pandemic_ for the initial card deal phase, but they can still shuffle the deck if another player removes the _Epidemic_ cards, deal the player cards, make a few stacks, add an _Epidemic_ card to each stack and finally shuffle each stack.

We should also mention the board orientation and positioning here. You can easily overlook this detail, yet it can make a huge difference for a partially sighted player. If the partially sighted player is new to the group, or simply shy by nature, they might not tell you that positioning the board closer to them helps them see the stuff on the board better. Make sure to ask this player how they want the board to be positioned, however, do not forget the sighted players as you don't want to accommodate one player while making gameplay uncomfortable for another.

## Assisting the Blind or Visually Impaired Player

There are games that blind people can play without any assistance, but for most modern board games, a sighted player will need to assist in one way or another. From my personal experience, most of the time it comes down to updating the blind player on the current board state. With the increase in plays of a certain game, and as the player gets more comfortable with the rules, they will require fewer updates from other players to refresh their memory on what is happening on the board. Announcing your own moves is extremely important as well, we discuss this in a little more detail in the next section.

If the game has text on the board or cards that are public knowledge, unless the cards have Braille or some other kind of marks, one sighted player will be required to read the text aloud. Note that, the blind or visually impaired player may not know how to read Braille, so even if you have a Braille kit, they might still require sighted assistance. 

Another area where sighted players can help is arranging cards or other components that are supposed to be hidden from other players in some order the blind player can memorize. This way, they won't require external help during the game. One issue with this is that it will only work for a small number of cards or other components.

An example would be, in _Camel Up_, the race winner and loser bets are supposed to be hidden from other players. What you can do to work around this is, at the start of the game, you can sort the 5 different cards in the order the blind player prefers, e.g. blue, yellow, green, orange, and white. It is easy to memorize a sequence of 5 different colors, so the blind player will not require assistance when they decide to place a final bet face down in the race winner or loser piles.

The best tip I can give you here is to be patient, especially if the blind or visually impaired player is playing a game for the first time. I constantly try to come up with more efficient ways to consume the game state information so that I can minimize the required assistance as much as possible. I should also stress here that blind people are not as helpless as many sighted people perceive. Yes, we need assistance in some areas, but we also adapt to low or no vision and find different ways to consume and memorize more information.

## Announce Your Moves

We briefly mentioned this, but let's explain why this is important. When sighted players play, explaining to the others what you are currently doing is not very common, since they can simply see what is happening on the board. All the blind player will know is that a dice has been rolled or a tile has been placed on the board by hearing a sound. This happens to me in almost all the game nights I have organized, and I kindly need to ask the sighted player what their move was. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that they are doing this deliberately to get an advantage, it is because they are used to consuming information by sight, so they simply forget to announce what they just played.

Announcing your moves lets the blind player keep track of what is going on. It is much easier to know how the board evolves in every step rather than wait until it's the blind player's turn and then give them a full update on the current game state. You should also remind another sighted player to announce their moves if they forget because the blind player may be shy and might stop asking after a couple of times. Bonus points should be awarded to the players that announce when their turn has ended and it is the next player's turn!

## Conclusion

Perhaps some of the things I have mentioned here sound like a no-brainer and obvious to you, but it is astounding how these little accommodations improve the experience both for the visually impaired person and others around  the table. Personally, I have a good time when I see that everyone else is having a good time. If there's sighted person around the table that struggles with a game, perhaps because it is too complex for them, I do not enjoy playing that game, even if it was my favorite game.

I hope some of the points made above will improve your overall experience when you have a blind or visually impaired player around your table. If you were considering inviting a blind friend to play tabletop games with your group, but weren't sure if they would be able to play, try to follow the advice above and you should all have a great time! 

For those of you that already play with blind or visually impaired friends, I would love to hear if you have any other suggestions to improve the quality of a gaming night.

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the main goal is to engage the blind player as much as possible, so it is a good idea to spend some thought when choosing a game to play. The less downtime the blind player has, the better the experience for everyone involved should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up and Tearing Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, these parts are considered to be the most boring parts in the game. However, if everyone is tasked to do something, it can both be faster and more entertaining than just sitting there and waiting for the host to set up everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blind and visually impaired players are at a disadvantage here as there are some things that they are not able to do or it simply takes longer for them to do. This does not mean that you should completely ignore them during these two stages of the game. A blind player can still shuffle cards, deal cards or other types of resources, count components and store components in plastic bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, they may not be able to remove the &lt;em&gt;Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; cards from the player card deck in &lt;em&gt;Pandemic&lt;/em&gt; for the initial card deal phase, but they can still shuffle the deck if another player removes the &lt;em&gt;Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; cards, deal the player cards, make a few stacks, add an &lt;em&gt;Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; card to each stack and finally shuffle each stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should also mention the board orientation and positioning here. You can easily overlook this detail, yet it can make a huge difference for a partially sighted player. If the partially sighted player is new to the group, or simply shy by nature, they might not tell you that positioning the board closer to them helps them see the stuff on the board better. Make sure to ask this player how they want the board to be positioned, however, do not forget the sighted players as you don&amp;#39;t want to accommodate one player while making gameplay uncomfortable for another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Assisting the Blind or Visually Impaired Player&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are games that blind people can play without any assistance, but for most modern board games, a sighted player will need to assist in one way or another. From my personal experience, most of the time it comes down to updating the blind player on the current board state. With the increase in plays of a certain game, and as the player gets more comfortable with the rules, they will require fewer updates from other players to refresh their memory on what is happening on the board. Announcing your own moves is extremely important as well, we discuss this in a little more detail in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the game has text on the board or cards that are public knowledge, unless the cards have Braille or some other kind of marks, one sighted player will be required to read the text aloud. Note that, the blind or visually impaired player may not know how to read Braille, so even if you have a Braille kit, they might still require sighted assistance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where sighted players can help is arranging cards or other components that are supposed to be hidden from other players in some order the blind player can memorize. This way, they won&amp;#39;t require external help during the game. One issue with this is that it will only work for a small number of cards or other components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example would be, in &lt;em&gt;Camel Up&lt;/em&gt;, the race winner and loser bets are supposed to be hidden from other players. What you can do to work around this is, at the start of the game, you can sort the 5 different cards in the order the blind player prefers, e.g. blue, yellow, green, orange, and white. It is easy to memorize a sequence of 5 different colors, so the blind player will not require assistance when they decide to place a final bet face down in the race winner or loser piles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best tip I can give you here is to be patient, especially if the blind or visually impaired player is playing a game for the first time. I constantly try to come up with more efficient ways to consume the game state information so that I can minimize the required assistance as much as possible. I should also stress here that blind people are not as helpless as many sighted people perceive. Yes, we need assistance in some areas, but we also adapt to low or no vision and find different ways to consume and memorize more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Announce Your Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We briefly mentioned this, but let&amp;#39;s explain why this is important. When sighted players play, explaining to the others what you are currently doing is not very common, since they can simply see what is happening on the board. All the blind player will know is that a dice has been rolled or a tile has been placed on the board by hearing a sound. This happens to me in almost all the game nights I have organized, and I kindly need to ask the sighted player what their move was. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m not saying that they are doing this deliberately to get an advantage, it is because they are used to consuming information by sight, so they simply forget to announce what they just played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcing your moves lets the blind player keep track of what is going on. It is much easier to know how the board evolves in every step rather than wait until it&amp;#39;s the blind player&amp;#39;s turn and then give them a full update on the current game state. You should also remind another sighted player to announce their moves if they forget because the blind player may be shy and might stop asking after a couple of times. Bonus points should be awarded to the players that announce when their turn has ended and it is the next player&amp;#39;s turn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of the things I have mentioned here sound like a no-brainer and obvious to you, but it is astounding how these little accommodations improve the experience both for the visually impaired person and others around  the table. Personally, I have a good time when I see that everyone else is having a good time. If there&amp;#39;s sighted person around the table that struggles with a game, perhaps because it is too complex for them, I do not enjoy playing that game, even if it was my favorite game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope some of the points made above will improve your overall experience when you have a blind or visually impaired player around your table. If you were considering inviting a blind friend to play tabletop games with your group, but weren&amp;#39;t sure if they would be able to play, try to follow the advice above and you should all have a great time! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that already play with blind or visually impaired friends, I would love to hear if you have any other suggestions to improve the quality of a gaming night.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a [link](https://imgur.com/a/t3zv3C2) to a gallery of images from the con. 

**Memoir 44**
Making wargaming easier, Memoir 44 is more than a board-game it's an engine/ruleset for war games. Many have applied the M44 system to other eras/genres. I played the base game several times, both storming and defending Normandy. There's many expansions including Civil War, Air Battles, etc.

**Terraforming Mars**
I played two intense sessions of Terraforming Mars with a great, patient fellow named Dennis. This is a game loosely based on the Red / Green / Blue Mars series of books - wherein Mars is turned into a habitable planet. You play as a corporation utilizing comet-impacts and microbes to transform Mars. The one with the most ""victory points"" at the end of the game wins.

**Century: Spice Road**
A card game where you earn/trade resources to buy cards to earn victory points. Great for 2 players, plus the design was superb. I really enjoyed this game and want to get it for casual gaming with my wife.

**Century: Eastern Wonders**
More resource trading, but this time on a board with ships and ports. Think ""Taipan"" with a colorful board game. Again, the design was wonderful and a ""just 30 min game"" stretched to over an hour as four players jostled to become the supreme trader. There were multiple ways to win, and my strategy worked!

**Here I Stand: Reformation Wars**
I didn't get a good look at this, but it looked something like Axis/Allies but with debates and proselytizing (and some real battles I think.) Every Reformation character was involved, Calvin, Luther, Melanchton and bunches of RC folks. This looked interesting, especially for Reformed folks like myself.

**Miniature War Gaming**
While I wanted to get into some of the miniatures gaming, the rules are often difficult to grasp. So I mostly watched. There's miniature gaming of every kind, typical WWII scenarios, Star Trek and Star Wars, Call of Cthulhu, Tall Ship battles, and everything in between.

**Dungeons and Dragons**
I spent 12 hours playing D&amp;D... I was amazed how organized things have become for large-session gaming like this. I haven't seriously played in 20 years. No longer can you claim to have the Sword of Most Righteous Truth with D20+12 necrotizing damage, you have to prove it! Each session at a Wizards of the Coast sponsored event is numbered and the dungeon master registered. XP (now called AC) and treasure (TC) is called out in the module - so your progress as a player is tracked. 3 good sessions with some interesting folks. Lots of fun, including some Dwarf Tossing was had.

**Splendor**
My wife really enjoyed ""Splendor"" (and bought it after we got home)- a game similar to Century: Spice Road where you earn resources to buy card, but this time it's mining and creating cut jewels during the Renaissance. You try to obtain resources to earn the favor of jewelers to eventually obtain patrons. It was complex and simple at the same time. I didn't do very well. :D

**Massive Darkness**
This appears to be the big contender in dungeon-crawling board games. It comes with 72 figures and randomized dungeon generation. I'm very interested in playing this, and need to find a group to sit in on. This might be the game I've been looking for. Looks pricey but I've wanted something mid-way between D&amp;D and a typical board game.

#**Real life**
Hey! My name is Eric. I'm 27. I've been married for almost 2 years. My son is about to turn 1. I work as a volunteer and community partnership coordinator at a family success center in South New Jersey. I also work part time as a youth &amp; young adults director at a small Christian church. My favorite superhero is St. Walker. My favorite band is Being As An Ocean. And yes, Em just killed it again with Kamikaze.

**How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?**
 
I went to a friend’s house in middle school. His older brother had just bought a new game called Arkham Horror. We wanted to play it. Spent the next 3+ hours playing. I instantly fell in love with the hobby side of gaming that day. After college, I decided to look into current board games and here I am.

#**Gaming habits**

**Do you customize your games? If so, can you describe one of the games you customized?**

I haven’t customized games but I plan on customizing Spirit Island with special presence tokens. I also hope to get some metal coins eventually. 

**How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?**
 
I play anywhere from 1 to 4 times a week. It really depends on who is available/how much free time I have. I mainly play 2-3 player. It is almost always with my wife and/or best friend. If no one is available, I’ll play games alone. I also try to go to a local meetup and I host a monthly meet up where I game with whoever shows up. Judging by BG Stats, the top three places I play are My House, My Meet Up, &amp; My Best Friend’s House.

**Do you have a BGG profile you'd like to share?**

#**Favorites**

**What is your Favorite Game and why?** 

That’s really hard for me to say. I have a top 5 that I all love almost the same. But if I had to pick one game right this second, the first to come to mind is Blood Rage. I am not a huge CMON fan. I am not a big minis fan. But I love all of the mechanics. I love the card drafting. I love the tactics. I love area control. I love action points. I love how combat resolves. I love how you get to create your strategy through the draft. I love being able to customize your clan. I never have a bad time playing this one.

**Favorite gateway game?**

In terms of what people typically call a gateway game, Carcassonne wins. Hands down. Simple. Fun. It’s been talked about forever. I have played this game with many children/youth who are beginning to learn games and this keeps being a success.

In terms of general games that can be a gateway game, Azul wins. I have brought this game out for all sorts of people who have not played hobby board games. It is constantly a hit. My inlaws even bought it after we played. If that is not a successful gateway game, I don’t know what is.

**Who is your Favorite Designer and why?**

It’s hard for me to pick one designer. I don’t really get to play multiple games from the same designer. The first that came to mind is Tim Fowers. His games are always intriguing. All of his designs are unique. They do something fun. They have interesting art. At the very least, I want to play them and see what his mind has come up with.

**Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?** 

Plan B. I enjoy abstracts. I feel like they get how to do abstract games. Their art and table presence is always solid. The game play is fun. Their games are accessible to non hobby gamers &amp; hobby gamers. They are one of the few publishers I look forward to hearing news about. 

**Favorite gaming mechanism?**

That is a toss up between set collection, drafting, &amp; area control.

**Favorite gaming component?**

That is a tie between the peppers in Scoville &amp; the invaders/dihan pieces in Spirit Island. Talk about immersion. 

**What game can you not stand or refuse to play?** 

I will never play Shark Tank. My wife’s whole family loves the tv show. I have spent many hours with her and/or her family watching this show. When I saw it on at the store, I figured it would be an average game. Playable and a good enough time because they love the show. It is literal trash. 

The rules were terrible. The game play, after spending way too much time reading the rule book, was lame. It wasn’t fun. No one liked it. AND THE DIE. The die made me lose my mind. They glued paper on the faces. They were that cheap when they made the game. How do you roll a die with poorly glued on paper? You don’t. How do you tolerate a die so blasphemous to gaming when the rules are incomplete? You don’t. So I threw it in the trash.

#**Q &amp; A**

**Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?**

I do try to give games a numerical rating. I think I should curate my collection to only have great games. Anything that is less than a 7 in my eyes, I don’t need and can be traded away.

I have given 2 games a 10/10; Blood Rage &amp; Spirit Island.

A 10/10 hits everything I am looking for. A strong theme that is complimented with fitting/fun mechanics. Those mechanics add to the theme as well. The game play experience always brings out an emotional response. The art pulls me deeper into the immersion. I find myself wanting to play “just one more game.” I will never turn down a game of it. If there was a fire and I could only grab a small stack, these are the ones I would instantly think of.

**Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?**

I would say I am hybrid gamer. I love all kinds of games. As you can see by explanation of a 10/10, I desire the “best” parts of Euro &amp; Ameritrash; strong game play/mechanics &amp; theme/emotional response. Sometimes that will involve a little luck; sometimes it will involve no luck. Both are fine with me if done correctly.

Those two categories of games can be helpful to give you an idea of what a particular game is generally like. Beyond that, I find it quite worthless. I feel like a lot of games don’t fit neatly into those two categories anymore. We have to grow past that and find a better way to classify games.

**What does /r/boardgames mean to you?**
 
This sub means a lot to me. This is truly a community. I see good conversations happening all of the time. I see great content being shared. I see people coming together due to a shared hobby. And truth be told, life can be hard. Life can feel lonely. Life is chaotic at times. To find a place where anyone is welcome means a lot. I know /r/boardgames has it’s flaws, like any group of humans. But I genuinely believe in the goodness that hobby board games has. This sub reflects that goodness far more than it obscures it.

**What's the much expensive game you've bought or considered buying? How do you determine if a game has been worth it's price?**

I thought about buying Gloomhaven but I knew it would become a life style game. I am constantly debating if I want Forbidden Stars, Mechs vs Minions, &amp; Underground Railroad. 

Primarily, I think about the price of a game similar to paying for an experience. Then it comes down to available capital, time investment, &amp; who can I play this game with.

**What's your favorite type of /r/boardgames content?**

If you couldn’t tell, community means a lot to me. So it may come as no surprise that [COMC] posts seem to be what I look forward to seeing the most. Watching the community share their collection  and share some of their thoughts brings about great discussions. If I find a game on a post and a lot of people don’t talk about it, I want to learn more about it. If I see a game that I own as well, I feel a certain connection as gamers. 

**What are your thoughts on crowdfunding board games? What's your favorite crowdfunded game?** 

I support crowdfunding. I do not support a lot of the bigger companies using that platform. I believe crowdfunding can be a great way to invest in an idea, a person. If we are to be a community, I think this element of the community is big. We trust in each other. Not blind trust but trust none the less. Let the designers earn the right to be trusted. 

It really is a shame bigger companies are using it the way they are. Logical from a profit point of view but really ruins the essence of what crowdfunding is.

My favorite crowdfunded game that I personally backed is Ravage. Easily my favorite dungeon crawler. It is the closest to how I want a dungeon crawl to make me feel &amp; has great mechanics. The art is great too. I am looking forward to the expansions &amp; custom user content down the road.  Seriously, if you like dungeon crawls, find someone with this game and give it a try.

**Do you consider yourself a collector of board games? What do you think about the collection aspect of the hobby?**

I would call myself a collector. To me, collecting is about curating. I don't want everything. I want certain, high quality, meaningful things. I want depth to collection. I want variety. I want quality. I don't think I'll ever want more than 100 games. My soft cap is 75.

**How many games are in your collection? Are you satisfied with that number?**

Assuming BGG is up to date, 43 games are in my collection. Out of those 43, I want 5 out of the collection (Betrayal, Blood of an Englishman, Harbour, Specter Ops, &amp; VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game). 

So far, I am pretty satisfied with where I am. There are 15 games I am looking to add to the collection &amp; about 10 I need to look more into.

**If you could only keep 10 games in your collection, what 10 would they be?**  

- Blood Rage  
- Spirit Island
- Adrenaline  
- Roll Player  
- Azul  
- Ravage  
- Village Pillage  
- Dream Home  
- Scoville  
- The Hare &amp; the Tortoise  

&amp;nbsp;

**Is there anything else you'd like to add?** 

Thank you to whoever nominated me! You’re the real MVP. 

Also, go listen to Ding&amp;Dent. Hands down my favorite podcast for board games.

[Past Meeples of the Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/meeple_of_the_week)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings board gamers! In an effort to spotlight some standout members of the &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; community, we present to you the Meeple of the Week! Every week we&amp;#39;ll be interviewing Reddit board gamers and presenting their profiles so you can get to know them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s meeple is &lt;a href=""/u/IrateGandhi""&gt;/u/IrateGandhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey! My name is Eric. I&amp;#39;m 27. I&amp;#39;ve been married for almost 2 years. My son is about to turn 1. I work as a volunteer and community partnership coordinator at a family success center in South New Jersey. I also work part time as a youth &amp;amp; young adults director at a small Christian church. My favorite superhero is St. Walker. My favorite band is Being As An Ocean. And yes, Em just killed it again with Kamikaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a friend’s house in middle school. His older brother had just bought a new game called Arkham Horror. We wanted to play it. Spent the next 3+ hours playing. I instantly fell in love with the hobby side of gaming that day. After college, I decided to look into current board games and here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you customize your games? If so, can you describe one of the games you customized?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t customized games but I plan on customizing Spirit Island with special presence tokens. I also hope to get some metal coins eventually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play anywhere from 1 to 4 times a week. It really depends on who is available/how much free time I have. I mainly play 2-3 player. It is almost always with my wife and/or best friend. If no one is available, I’ll play games alone. I also try to go to a local meetup and I host a monthly meet up where I game with whoever shows up. Judging by BG Stats, the top three places I play are My House, My Meet Up, &amp;amp; My Best Friend’s House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a BGG profile you&amp;#39;d like to share?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/user/IrateHope""&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/user/IrateHope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your Favorite Game and why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s really hard for me to say. I have a top 5 that I all love almost the same. But if I had to pick one game right this second, the first to come to mind is Blood Rage. I am not a huge CMON fan. I am not a big minis fan. But I love all of the mechanics. I love the card drafting. I love the tactics. I love area control. I love action points. I love how combat resolves. I love how you get to create your strategy through the draft. I love being able to customize your clan. I never have a bad time playing this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gateway game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what people typically call a gateway game, Carcassonne wins. Hands down. Simple. Fun. It’s been talked about forever. I have played this game with many children/youth who are beginning to learn games and this keeps being a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of general games that can be a gateway game, Azul wins. I have brought this game out for all sorts of people who have not played hobby board games. It is constantly a hit. My inlaws even bought it after we played. If that is not a successful gateway game, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is your Favorite Designer and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard for me to pick one designer. I don’t really get to play multiple games from the same designer. The first that came to mind is Tim Fowers. His games are always intriguing. All of his designs are unique. They do something fun. They have interesting art. At the very least, I want to play them and see what his mind has come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan B. I enjoy abstracts. I feel like they get how to do abstract games. Their art and table presence is always solid. The game play is fun. Their games are accessible to non hobby gamers &amp;amp; hobby gamers. They are one of the few publishers I look forward to hearing news about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gaming mechanism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a toss up between set collection, drafting, &amp;amp; area control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gaming component?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a tie between the peppers in Scoville &amp;amp; the invaders/dihan pieces in Spirit Island. Talk about immersion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What game can you not stand or refuse to play?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will never play Shark Tank. My wife’s whole family loves the tv show. I have spent many hours with her and/or her family watching this show. When I saw it on at the store, I figured it would be an average game. Playable and a good enough time because they love the show. It is literal trash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If there was a fire and I could only grab a small stack, these are the ones I would instantly think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say I am hybrid gamer. I love all kinds of games. As you can see by explanation of a 10/10, I desire the “best” parts of Euro &amp;amp; Ameritrash; strong game play/mechanics &amp;amp; theme/emotional response. Sometimes that will involve a little luck; sometimes it will involve no luck. Both are fine with me if done correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two categories of games can be helpful to give you an idea of what a particular game is generally like. Beyond that, I find it quite worthless.

&lt;p&gt;I thought about buying Gloomhaven but I knew it would become a life style game. I am constantly debating if I want Forbidden Stars, Mechs vs Minions, &amp;amp; Underground Railroad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, I think about the price of a game similar to paying for an experience. Then it comes down to available capital, time investment, &amp;amp; who can I play this game with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What&amp;#39;s your favorite type of &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; content?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Adrenaline&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I have been playing board games for as long as I can remember.  I still have my copy of **Marvel Super Heroes** from when I was 10 years old.  However, I have only been a collector for just over 3 years now.  Like a lot of people I started expanding my knowledge of the hobby with **Catan**, but I actually found it in a different way.  I hadn't heard of the board game, but instead downloaded the Xbox 360 Arcade version and was hooked.  Shortly after I purchased a physical copy and both my level of immersion and my collection have grown since.

The biggest change I'm going to have to make is buying additional Kallax shelves soon since I have a bunch of Kickstarters delivering and am running out of space.  Unfortunately, that little project is on hold until we move from our Bronx apartment to a house!

My favorite game right now is **Terraforming Mars**.  We recently picked up the **Prelude** expansion and it definitely jump starts things for the better.  My newest game is **Tiny Epic Zombies** which just delivered this Saturday.  We played it this weekend and although the game kicked our butts, we are eager to get it back to the table.

There are still a few games that I haven't got to play yet that are on the shelves.  Most of that is because I don't get to play 3+ player games nearly as much as I do 2 player games since my fiancee is my main gaming partner.  Right now the game I haven't played that I really want to break out is **Feast for Odin** but that is sitting more because I need to get through the rule books.

Hopefully you all enjoy the post.  Thanks for looking!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/kTDqnVD""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/kTDqnVD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I really like to play board games but I don't currently have a lot of people to play with, for a number of reasons. My girlfriend of 6 years has never been a big fan of board games. She'll play when we go to board games cafes with friends but it's not usually her favourite activity. More specifically, she doesn't enjoy big strategic games and she gets bored when the rules get too complexed.

Recently, I've mentioned to her that I'd like to try playing a game together so that we can have another activity to share. We looked online and we agreed on Pandemic Legacy has she was attracted by the idea of us playing together instead of against each other. In addition we're both physicians and medicine nerds so that worked out well. I'm pretty excited and she appears to be as well.


However, I'd like to masked the experience for her as pleasant as possible. I want her to enjoy the game so that she gets excited about it.

This game looks deadly in many respects, but my one big concern is lack of significant replayability. The Realm of Knowledge card pool isn't too extensive. Has anyone played on Tabletopia, or any other way, and can comment? It just seems like before long you'd be seeing the same sort of combo appear over and over.

Since the win condition really centers on dealing damage, I'm not sure about the general argument that you can experiment with lots of different play styles. Defensive cards could be handy in the moment, but isn't running one kind of just a stall tactic? Like, eventually you have to ditch that style and just shard up the most efficient damage cards before other ppl do, no?

Maybe a TLDR is that it seems a bit to easily ""solvable""?

This is my third installment of my weekly reddit post called 10 Things You Should Know, eventually to be shortened to 10TYSK. This week we're covering Aeon's End, a deck-building co-operative game by Kevin Riley, published by Action Phase Games and Indie Boards and Games. Each player acts as a mage trying to defeat an extremely powerful nemesis (think Cthulhu types) by casting spells into breaches to deal damage. If the nemesis' HP is drained or his/her deck is depleted before the nemesis destroys the mages or their city, the players win.

1. **If you love deckbuilding, but hate shuffling, this is the deckbuilder for you.** You never have to shuffle your deck, you just flip it over to restart it. This adds another layer of strategy as to how you arrange your discard pile to maximize your deck's efficiency and power.

2. **If you don't like deckbuilding, there isn't enough new game here to satisfy you.** I like to think of this game as a cross between Sentinels of the Multiverse and Big Book of Madness. If those games don't get you excited, this game probably won't either. However, I'm not a *huge* deck-builder guy in general, but this is my favorite one. I have also played Legendary Encounters Aliens, Marvel Legendary, Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle, Clank, Big Book of Madness, and Dominion. So I do have a little experience with the genre.

3. **Set up and take down are the worst parts of the game**, and eventually you may want to house rule the way you do this. Before each game you have to construct the deck for the nemesis, your individual starter decks, and you have to randomly build the market with 3 gems, 4 spells, and 2 relics. If you buy enough expansions, this will give a TON of options for each category. But you'll also eventually find that without certain types of gems, relics, spells, or player powers, winning a game is extremely difficult, if not impossible.

4. As with all co-op deckbuilders, **you may find some games more frustratingly difficult than others**. However, if you play co-op deck-builders, you probably already know this. Sometimes you just get a brutal combination of cards. This game doesn't suffer from Harry Potter-like problems where an opening villain combo means you just have to reshuffle before even attempting to beat them, but it can derail your game. The game does have built in tiers of card difficult like Legendary Aliens and Predator, so that helps.

5. **There are essentially two base games**: Aeon's End (AE) and War Eternal (WE). You can buy either one and have everything you need to play and add expansions to without buying the other. Buying both will give you double sets of only starter cards like sparks and crystal. Everything else will be unique, so if you want more variations in nemeses, nemeses base cards, spells, relics, or gems, go ahead and buy both.

5. **The artwork is nice, the insert is terrible**. If you love great inserts, you will find nothing of the kind in this game. It's cheap cardboard. I have organized my copies into two boxes, one with all the nemeses cards, and one with all the hero cards. The games do come with dividers to enable some quicker set up. What I've done since I have both AE and WE is use a label maker to further organize my cards into alphabetical groupings so I can find spells, relics, and gems even quicker.

6. **Each nemesis is different enough so games feel unique in terms of strategy and play**. They are not all beaten by buying the biggest baddest spells and pounding them into oblivion. With the more difficult level villains, you may find it takes you 2-3 tries to defeat them, and you may find yourself having to try different types of player powers and market cards to defeat them. This is where house ruling comes into play. Personally, I enjoy playing each villain first with purely random market cards (gems, relics, and spells). If we are defeated, we start custom choosing our market cards for the next attempt.

7. **The game never feels so complicated and fiddly that you need a notepad or app to track adjustments**. I mentioned Sentinels of the Multiverse as a comparison. SotM is known for its insane levels of fiddliness. Aeon's End does not have that sort of problem. Anything that needs to be tracked is easily done with tokens that go in their required place, and is not complicated. You may find, at most, that you just need to do a minor adjustment or two to your spells' damage levels which can easily be monitored.

8. **Each game takes roughly an hour**. And that's definitely a plus for this type of game. You can easily get in 1-3 sessions in a night. I enjoy this more than say Year 7 of Harry Potter where I have to go through all 7 years of villains in order to beat the final year.

9. **Replayability is not super high**. I don't see myself playing nemeses again and again. Perhaps, after I beat them all, I may try to beat the more fun ones on their advanced difficulty setting, but I'm not even sure about that. This game is fun, but it doesn't get my blood boiling for more plays. I bought this wanting to try a new type of deckbuilder, and bought expansions because there is a guy in my group who LOVES it. There are lots of small ways to tweak a nemesis more to your preference. If you want an easier game or a harder game, you can also adjust HP of the nemesis or city or even heroes.

10. **There is a legacy version coming out later this year.** If you are interested in the game, but want something even more unique, you might consider waiting for that. If you decide to buy AE or WE now, they are compatible with the legacy game. The legacy game is semi-resettable) you need a pack. 

I hope this helps if you're considering buying this. Next week we'll discuss Twilight Struggle!

Recently my wife and I have been looking for ways to trim down the collection as well as procure some fodder for upcoming Math Trades. We have gone through many different methods in order to remove some of the games in our collection, but have come to enjoy one in particular.

This method I'll call the 5 In A Row Challenge. I originally read about it from someone else on this sub who mentioned it as a way to remove games from their collection (credit goes to them entirely, this is just a reporting of our experience). We were skeptical at first, but then we decided to try it.

The 5 In A Row Challenge is simply a gauntlet of 5 plays of the same game in a row (over multiple play sessions). For example, we played 7 Wonders: Duel as the first candidate for the challenge. We played it 3 times the first day and 2 more times another day. The only stipulation is that you can't play anything other than the selected game until you're finished with the 5 plays.

The game fails the challenge if at any time while you're playing the game you think to yourself ""I don't want to play this again..."" Oppositely the game passes if it makes it through the 5 play gauntlet if you never think the above statement.

This all stems from my (perhaps unpopular) opinion that there is no point in owning games that you wouldn't want to play all the time.

So what does this do? The 5 In A Row Challenge allows me to quickly see which games should really belong in my collection. Obviously YMMV depending on your circumstances, but it works very well for us (we can't all play TI4 whenever we want to, or even 5 times in a row for that matter).

It also allows you to delve more deeply into the strategy involved with the game you're currently playing. Example: My wife and I put Abyss on the list just yesterday and actually had the time to crank out 5 games in about 2 hours. After the third game, I began to see common aspects in the winning strategies that were used across the games. We'd played the game 9 times before this already, but this was new to me. It was a cool experience to see an overarching strategy emerge from our multiple play sessions. As a result, we both became better players of the game. This probably would not have happened if we had played Abyss over the course of a few months interspersed with other games. The raw exposure allowed us to learn new tactics and strategies.

I just thought I'd throw this out there. Has anyone else tried anything similar to this and achieved similar results?

EDIT 1: It has been brought to my attention (and I agree) that this largely only applies to games that are on the lighter side. 

EDIT 2/Rant: I haven't changed the original text because I guess I've learned that I'm just more tolerant relative to everyone else. I don't get burned out playing a game multiple times. Every game in my collection has seen more than 5 plays because it deserves that many (or more). I have no shelf of shame because it's a waste. You could grab any game in my collection and (given that we had the time and player count to play it) I would play it, no hesitation. But all in all, to each his own. It's part of being in a hobby, you get to define how you enjoy it :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all!&lt;/p&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.

What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.

Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.

Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.

A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

Note: Descent Journeys in the Dark 2E was Game of the Week on /r/boardgames [five years ago today](/1lshqe). This GoTW repost gives people of the sub a chance to discuss the game again after a bit of time has passed. Do you still play it? If so, how often does it make it to the table? Has the game held up after repeated plays? Has it moved up or down in your personal ranking? Has it been replaced by a newer, similar game? Has it replaced a game?

Descent features story-driven encounters that will find the heroes exploring caves, dungeons, ruins, and engaging in battle against numerous monsters and enemies controlled by the overlord.

Get a faculty sponsor to host the meetings. I already have a few teachers in mind, and I know I can get 15 signatures. What I’m really looking for advice on is the mission statement. My current one is “to provide students of (my school) with a fun environment to play board games and meet new friends.” I have a decent sized &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/e4GMnpk.jpg""&gt;collection &lt;/a&gt; so I’m not worried about acquiring the games as much as teaching so many new people so many new games. Advice?

While I love Blood Rage, I think the game gets hurt in the variety department by containing some very underpowered cards that rarely ever get drafted in its limited card pool.

Since board games can't benefit from timely updates for balance changes like online games, I've come up with a few ideas on how to change them so they're still low tier but fullfil their respective niches better. I'm also trying to change the Dwarf Chieftain and the Soldier of Hel into more interesting cards, as they provide no combos and are just free stat sticks. Besides those 2, it seems the general consensus for the worst offenders in the game are:

​

# AGE 1

* **Thor's Glory**  (Cost 2 **-** Gain 2 glory whenever at least 2 enemy figures are destroyed in a battle you participate in.)  
This card is awful because it costs at least 33% of your rage in Age 1 (likely more since some will be siphoned out by Loki), takes up a clan upgrade slot and provides a rather marginal (and very conditional!) benefit. It needs to trigger 3 times to beat out an Age 1 quest, while costing rage to play (on the Age you'll likely need it most), being arguably harder to trigger and not advancing a clan stat.  
*My suggestion: Making the upgrade* ***cost only 1 rage and upping the reward to 3 glory***. *It should give some legs to the card into the late game and tie in nicely with Valkirie, which is another card that can afford a little help through sinergy.*  

* **Tyr's Domain**  (Cost 0 **-**  After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +3 battle card.)  
To play this you'll lose a turn in Age 1, have to draft more quests instead of potentially more useful cards and if you win the battle you played the quest in you'll end up losing your quest card, not to mention this takes up a clan upgrade slot. All of that for turning quests into mediocre battle cards.  
*My suggestion:* **Make it cost 2, but give it a rather powerful extra effect - you get to keep the quest card used as a +3 battle card even if you win the battle.** *This makes it so you take a significant hit in rage at age 1 in exchange for a lot of future flexibility regarding your draft in the next 2 ages. It is also still susceptible to being countered by the card canceling battle cards in Age 2 and 3, and forces you to reveal at least one quest in your hand. Credits to* /u/MicromegaX.  

* **Dwarf Chieftain**  (Cost 2\* **-**  \*Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)The Chieftain is a very decent monster, but it's also quite bland. In a game that's all about combos, it has pretty much 0 sinergy with anything else. Having a retail copy of the game, I'd like to fill up the spot left vacant by the Mountain Giant, as he increases the value in the ""lord"" line of cards, which are generally mid-to-low tier.  
*My suggestion: Rather than straight up proxying the Mountain Giant, I'd like this little dude to* ***cost 2 rage, have 2 STR and count as a leader***. *This is thematic - Dwarf CHIEFTAIN counts as a weaker leader and also has a nice parallel with how the Hydra is a stronger boat in Age 1. The reduction in cost is offset by the weaker STR for the rest of the game and better enables use of the overcosted Lord of Hammers without having to mess with that card as well.*  

* **Lord of Hammers  (Cost 3** \- If you successfully pillage with your leader, you may move him to an adjacent province.)  
While this might net a nice tempo gain, the cost in the first Age is ridiculous for the effect.  
*My suggestion:* **lowering the cost down to 2** *along with having a second leader in the game should help this see some fringe play.*  
 

# 

# AGE 2

There's nothing really egregious about Age 2, I feel it is the best balanced in the game.

​

&amp;#x200B;

# AGE 3

* **Völur Witch**  (Cost 3 - May retreat from an outer province to Yggdrasil instead of being destroyed.)  
Simply costs too much for what it does, even though what it does can certainly be useful for draining opponent's battle cards.  
*My suggestion: I'd like to take a page out of the scrapped design for the Mystic Troll and make this* ***cost 2 rage, have 2 STR, but provide 1 bonus STR for up to 4 of your warriors in the same province***. *This means that accompanied by no warriors it's strictly worse than the already middling monster Soldier of Hel (since the Witch would cost 1 rage), but it also has a higher ceiling, particularly for Yggdrasil battles, where it can potentially provide 6 strength. This is also rather thematic, as the Volur Witch can be thought of as giving bloodlust to your warriors.*  

* **Tyr's Wrath (Cost 1** \- After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +5 battle card.)  
This manages to be even worse than it's first age cousin, if only because there are so many better options in the third age and the action economy is even more valuable because this age tends to end quickly. Also worth noting that third age quests are worth tons of points, so if this is going to see play it needs to provide a more powerful effect.  
*My suggestion: Make it* ***cost 0 rage, make the quest count as a +3 battle card that can be used after battle cards are revealed****. Still not sure this would be enough to make it see play.*  

* **Soldier of Hel** (Cost 3\* - \*Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)  
Like the Dwarf Chieftain, this dude is OK (actually worse than his Dwarven friend as he offers only a +1 STR a full 2 ages later), but he's rather bland and offers no sinergy.  
*My suggestion: Let's make this dude what the Volur Witch should have been from the start:* ***2 STR, costs no rage to invade and retreats to Yggdrasil rather than being destroyed***. *With no cost and 2 STR he'll be better suited for losing battles and draining your opponent's battle cards. Quite thematic that this zombie-like figure refuses to stay dead and springs forth from Yggdrasil time and time again.*

I would like some experienced BR players to chime in on what I'm doing with these cards balance wise. Did I go too far, did I not push hard enough. Please let me know!

&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: I&amp;#39;d like to take a page out of the scrapped design for the Mystic Troll and make this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cost 2 rage, have 2 STR, but provide 1 bonus STR for up to 4 of your warriors in the same province&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;This means that accompanied by no warriors it&amp;#39;s strictly worse than the already middling monster Soldier of Hel (since the Witch would cost 1 rage), but it also has a higher ceiling, particularly for Yggdrasil battles, where it can potentially provide 6 strength. This is also rather thematic, as the Volur Witch can be thought of as giving bloodlust to your warriors.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyr&amp;#39;s Wrath (Cost 1&lt;/strong&gt; - After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +5 battle card.)&lt;br/&gt;
This manages to be even worse than it&amp;#39;s first age cousin, if only because there are so many better options in the third age and the action economy is even more valuable because this age tends to end quickly. Also worth noting that third age quests are worth tons of points, so if this is going to see play it needs to provide a more powerful effect.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: Make it&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cost 0 rage, make the quest count as a +3 battle card that can be used after battle cards are revealed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Still not sure this would be enough to make it see play.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soldier of Hel&lt;/strong&gt; (Cost 3* - *Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)&lt;br/&gt;
Like the Dwarf Chieftain, this dude is OK (actually worse than his Dwarven friend as he offers only a +1 STR a full 2 ages later), but he&amp;#39;s rather bland and offers no sinergy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: Let&amp;#39;s make this dude what the Volur Witch should have been from the start:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 STR, costs no rage to invade and retreats to Yggdrasil rather than being destroyed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;With no cost and 2 STR he&amp;#39;ll be better suited for losing battles and draining your opponent&amp;#39;s battle cards. Quite thematic that this zombie-like figure refuses to stay dead and springs forth from Yggdrasil time and time again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like some experienced BR players to chime in on what I&amp;#39;m doing with these cards balance wise. Did I go too far, did I not push hard enough. Please let me know!  &lt;/p&gt;

This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

 [Tip Jar](https://www.paypal.me/Zelbinian/1) - Keep me in Kickstarter money.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this is:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm looking at maybe going all in on the currently running Pearlbrook expansion Kickstarter fundraiser and get Everdell and the expansion. That said, I like to do my research, and while I read a lot of ebullient, simplistic reviews and listened to a few uncritical podcast epsodes, the review by these guys (Mile High Game Guys) left me with some doubts as to whether the game is more hype than long-term substance and has some real flaws.

The reviewers raised the following points:
- Unreliable chaining of creatures and buildings that doesn't help (unlike chaining in 7 Wonders, which while still a gamble, is much less costly if it fails to achieve
- Too much luck in achieving requirements of the major Event cards
- Interesting mechanics haphazardly thrown together without any real synergies.
- Too random a card draw which makes the game overall too random as the card draws are the meat of this essentially tableau-building game.
- Can go on a little long, even without new people or AP-prone people
- Tree is gimmicky and is in the way of player, blocking sight of potentially useful card.
- Too feeble worker placement action
- Player performance lives or dies based on the luck of deck draws.

On a side note, not that i want that to be the focus of discussion, but I am interested in Viticulture EE and Tuscany EE, which I think I'll like based on my experience of Troyes, a relatively similar game, mechanically speaking.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello,&lt;/p&gt;

You'll need a printer that can handle double-sided printing for the print-and-play cards, but they're specially formatted to work in black and white. 

We recommend printing the cards themselves on basic cardstock, and the Investigator form on regular printer paper. We've included a version of the VK-82S that allows players to circle a verdict rather than stamp the form. Each sheet contains three forms; a single play session usually uses ten to twenty forms.

Finally... this is an opportunity for us to do some large-scale blind playtesting of the cards themselves. We know the framework of the game is solid, but we don't have as much data on the individual cards as we'd like. When you finish a round and someone else cycles in to play, it would be great if you could pull out your phone and give us some details about how your playtest went!

The reason to buy this expansion, though, is that it comes with a hardcore version of all of the objectives and locations from the base game as well as for the new ones. This expansion also changes the rules slightly to ramp up difficulty, along with including more difficult enemies and more vicious strikes.

It seems to me that many of the most popular gateway games often make use of a very satisfying interaction that doesn't often get recognized.  Namely, that players are able to influence the game in such a manner that they are able to permanently benefit from their opponents for the rest of the game, and their opponents are often incentivized to benefit them.  For example, in Monopoly this manifests as paying rent to players who have purchased a property before they landed on it.  In Catan, players are more likely to trade with you if you build a city next to a desirable resource.  In 7 Wonders, players must pay their opponents for access to cleverly selected resources.  In Lords of Waterdeep, players receive benefits when their opponents use buildings that they have built, rewarding properly reading the board and their opponents.

I think what is so satisfying about this mechanic is that it forces players to give you something, and allows you to cleverly manipulate the board to encourage them to do so, thus driving regular player interaction and giving players the feeling of outplaying each other head-to-head without ever requiring direct conflict or ""take that"" mechanics.  It is directly competitive and can be clearly pre-meditated without being overtly mean, which is a level of interaction that I think non-gamers are drawn to before they get a greater sense of appreciation for all of the facets that go into board game design. It also results in players receiving physical rewards for their clever play, which serves to amplify the feeling of satisfaction that they experience.

Now, the reason I mention this is because, while I find most of the games I have listed above to be good games, I don't really want any of them in my collection.  Monopoly is a chore.  Catan takes too long for what it is.  7 Wonders is a great game that I personally find a bit bland.  Lords of Waterdeep is really cool, but it can be difficult to convince non-gamers to play it because of the theme, and a lot of people find the cube pushing to be immersion-breaking (I personally don't find it to be an issue because the game and art is so strong).

So, I basically want to ask two questions.  1.  Is there a name for the mechanism/interaction I have described above?  I can only describe it as piggybacking, but I can't use that to search for game son BGG.  2.  Can anyone recommend games that feature this that are not heavier economic games?

Looking forward to hearing thoughts :).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be a silly post, but I have been thinking recently about what I enjoy in games, how I can choose the right games to engage my friends and family (who are less gamer-y than I am), and why certain games have become so pervasive in popular culture even when most board gamers find them to be banal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It seems to me that many of the most popular gateway games often make use of a very satisfying interaction that doesn&amp;#39;t often get recognized.  Namely, that players are able to influence the game in such a manner that they are able to permanently benefit from their opponents for the rest of the game, and their opponents are often incentivized to benefit them.  For example, in Monopoly this manifests as paying rent to players who have purchased a property before they landed on it.  In Catan, players are more likely to trade with you if you build a city next to a desirable resource.  In 7 Wonders, players must pay their opponents for access to cleverly selected resources.

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2: would a game of Forbidden Island (already own) be a &lt;strong&gt;good test&lt;/strong&gt; to see who is interested before beginning this commitment?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit 2 (continued): I was thinking about playing during lunch. Could we reliably &lt;strong&gt;finish a game in 60-90 minutes&lt;/strong&gt;? If not, I guess it’ll have to be after work. &lt;/p&gt;

&gt;There's a good board game buried deep beneath this finicky city-builder.

\[snip\]

&gt;The graphic design is weirdly anonymous. The base map is practically featureless beyond the four types of building zones; the road tiles are all generic eight-point crossroads, giving the city a tepid otherworldliness as more unnatural thoroughfares are placed; and the building tiles—which I’m sure are faithful representations of *Gloomhaven* locations and will bring the joy of recognition to its players—just look bland. The character art is nice, mind you, and the *Gloomhaven* mythos is fairly imaginative; there’s just an odd disconnect between this game and the rich world it lives in.  
&gt;  
&gt;The iconography, however, is baffling in the extreme. Some of the resource icons are obvious, such as food, jewellery, and cattle. But the icons for knowledge, government, or machinery are not obvious at all, and in the melee of logistical optimization and competing game mechanics, it becomes hard to remember that you’re connecting tangible commodities rather than abstract icons which generate newer, more powerful icons. This isn’t a mechanical problem, but the more you abstract a game from its setting, the less it all means to the average player—and the more it feels like you’re rattling around a two-dimensional Rubik’s Cube.  
&gt;  
&gt;Matters are not helped by the races, which might again be tremendously thematic for the average *Gloomhaven* player but which feel completely divorced from anything that anyone else might know. They each have a racial power (read: some minor rule-breaking ability), but without knowledge of what makes a Quatryl different from a Valrath, it’s just another kink in the algorithm. Even the humans, with their power to gain additional voting influence, feel pretty same-y with all the other races. (And this is after a Kickstarter stretch goal introduced custom meeples for each race, all in different shapes and colors. But because the actual game piece barely does anything, and because they’re tiny little wooden cut-outs, little gameplay difference is made, again.)  
&gt;  
&gt;There’s also the weirdest little ""legacy"" aspect in the box: the first person to win a game, once a few games have been played and everyone is comfortable, gets to name some of the game areas, writing them on a little card—and then that’s what they’re called in perpetuity. It doesn’t change anything about later games, and there’s no extra stuff added. Maybe that’s fun for *Gloomhaven* completionists, but it’s a weird addition for the rest of us.  
&gt;  
&gt;As is often the case, a game designed for one to four players is at its best with four. It doesn’t work that well with two, but the puzzle presented by the solitaire version unexpectedly shines—and I say this as someone who hates one-player games. It’s a cunning puzzle; each move matters and careful planning is vital.  
&gt;  
&gt;*Founders of Gloomhaven* is simultaneously too complex and too abstract, too stuffed with ideas and too divorced from the richness of its own setting, to be truly recommended. (Oh, and the rules are positively *begging* to be properly copyedited.)  
&gt;  
&gt;At its heart lurks a satisfying game of supply chain logistics skinned with a kind of city constructor, but it’s finicky to learn and complicated to play. The core loop of the game is elegant enough, but it never quite feels like its own thing, and the melange of additional (and unnecessary) rules makes it hard to teach and easy to mess up.

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of Elliott over at [Legendesque](https://legendesque.com). Legendesque is an online card and board game store that offers free shipping in the US at $100, or $6 flat-rate shipping on all other orders.

Legendesque has generously donated the following prizes:

* A copy of **First Martians** (this is the pre-order version with washed/painted minis)
* A copy of **Brass:Birmingham** 
* A copy of **Colosseum**
* A copy of **5 Minute Marvel**
* A copy of **Fabled Fruit**
* A copy of **Takenoko**

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What is your all-time favorite game component, either because of its role in the gameplay, or just because it’s a cool bit of bling?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship to the US ONLY.

##The fine print

These giveaways are open until 5:30 a.m. Pacific time the day after they are posted. Comments made after 5:30 a.m. will not be eligible to win. Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Previous giveaway winners are not eligible to win additional giveaways. Anyone caught attempting to game the system by leaving multiple comments in a single post will be disqualified from this and all subsequent giveaways. 

If you’re eligible for two giveaways in a single day, you may enter both, though we ask you to consider your level of interest in the specific prizes before doing so, out of consideration for those who may be eligible for only one giveaway.

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate, everyone who replied to our solicitations for donations was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the companies providing prizes for these giveaways.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

Good luck!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help mark &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9g1jg3/happy_10th_birthday_rboardgames/""&gt;10 years of /r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;, we’re hosting a series of great giveaways from some of your favorite designers, publishers, and retailers!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of Elliott over at &lt;a href=""https://legendesque.com""&gt;Legendesque&lt;/a&gt;. Legendesque is an online card and board game store that offers free shipping in the US at $100, or $6 flat-rate shipping on all other orders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Legendesque has generously donated the following prizes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of &lt;strong&gt;First Martians&lt;/strong&gt; (this is the pre-order version with washed/painted minis)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of &lt;strong&gt;Brass:Birmingham&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of &lt;strong&gt;Colosseum&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of &lt;strong&gt;5 Minute Marvel&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of &lt;strong&gt;Fabled Fruit&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A copy of &lt;strong&gt;Takenoko&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;To enter&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be eligible to win, you &lt;em&gt;must have previously commented in &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; prior to Sept. 15&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To enter, all you have to do is &lt;em&gt;leave a top-level comment&lt;/em&gt; answering the following question:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your all-time favorite game component, either because of its role in the gameplay, or just because it’s a cool bit of bling?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Shipping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This giveaway will ship to the US ONLY.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;The fine print&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These giveaways are open until 5:30 a.m. Pacific time the day after they are posted. Comments made after 5:30 a.m. will not be eligible to win. Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, &lt;em&gt;please do not enter&lt;/em&gt;. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, &lt;em&gt;please do not enter&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

I recently bought the Game of Thrones 2nd edition board game off of one of those Facebook marketplace groups. Sadly one of the Lannister house card is missing - Tywin Lannister.

The guy has offered me a refund, but I thought I'd ask around first and try and find one. It seems a shame to bin an otherwise perfectly decent copy over a single missing piece. 

Does anyone have, or know someone who has, an old, beat up copy they're looking to get rid of for cheap? Or maybe you can think of another way to replace a missing card? Open to suggestions.

As most questions the answer depends on several factors such as budget, quality or personal preference. I sleeve pretty much all my games and I've tried a couple of brands. Hopefully my experiences will help others make a more informed decision.

**Note**: in order to make a price comparison simpler at a glance I am listing the price per 100 sleeves, even though some brands only sell packs of 50. 

Name | Mini-review | Microns | Price (100 sleeves) | Price Quality
---|---|----|----|----
Penny sleeves, mayday standard, etc | These sleeves are terrible. They are very loose on the cards, come out when shuffling, split often and have bad quality. They're cheap but you get what you paid for.  | &lt;= 40| 1-2€ |  ★☆☆☆☆
KMC perfect fit | These sleeves are typically used for double sleeving but if you're on a budget these are probably your best option. The sleeves are very fit to the card and don't add much volume. They are leagues ahead the penny sleeves, typically cost twice as much. Sometimes it's hard to find them on the cheap, I would recommend something else if you are gonna pay 4+ euros per pack | 45 | 2-4€ | ★★☆☆☆
Mayday Premium | These are my typical go-to sleeves. You can get them pretty much anywhere and they'll get the job done. The cards sit comfortably on the sleeve, the thickness is good enough. Shuffle feel is a bit ""rocky"" but it's okay. Some people complain about size consistency issues, personally never experienced them or noticed them. | 90 | 4-6€ | ★★★☆☆
Fantasy Flight  Games | These pretty much like the Mayday Premium, though they are a bit thicker. They tend to be slightly more expensive and they honestly feel the same to me so I tend to get Maydays instead. | 105 | 4-7€ | ★★★☆☆
Arcane Tinmen | Some people say these sleeves have a great quality so I'm leaning to assume I got a ""standard"" version instead of a premium version. I tried their matte sleeves and they were terrible. Card wouldn't stay in the sleeve, like a penny sleeve. Wouldn't recommend that particular pack, maybe there's a Premium version? | 80 | 4-6€ | ★☆☆☆☆
Ultra Pro | This brand makes a point of sticking an obnoxious hologram on their sleeves. I don't wanna put the hologram on the back of the card because that will mark it, I don't wanna put the hologram on the front of the card because it will get in the way. Seriously makes me avoid this brand as a whole. The sleeves are of similar quality to FFG, with same advantages and disadvantages + a hologram | 100? | 4-6€ | ★★★☆☆
Dragon Shield Matte | It's very rare to find Matte transparent sleeves and I absolutely love Matte sleeves. It has a slightly ""rugged"" back which improves card grip (also makes it unsuitable for double-sided cards). These are by far my favorite sleeves right now, very thick, super solid quality, matte back, great shuffle feel. The one problem is price but you get what you paid for the quality is fantastic AND IT'S MATTE!  | 120 | 8€ | ★★★★☆
Dragon Shield | Dragon shield also carries a non-matte version. These are also of superior quality, I like to use them for double-sided cards such as cheat sheets. Again, very thick, super solid quality, great shuffle feel, price is unfortunately the problem. | 120 | 8€ | ★★★★☆
KMC Hyper Mat Translucent | I love the Dragon Shield Matte but the high price point made me try other brands, especially when a game has a lot of cards. KMC Hyper mat are an excellent alternative AND MATTE. I think these the absolute best price/quality sleeves. They provided a matte back, great shuffle feel, quality sleeves, no size inconsistencies. The shuffle feel is even better than dragon shield's. The one problem is getting them, especially in Europe. I ordered them from japan at 2.5 euros per 80, most stores charge double... | ?? | 3-7€ | ★★★★★

If you were hoping to find non-transparent sleeves I will point you the Tolarian Community College's youtube which has an excellent and exhaustive evaluation of pretty much every brand. [This is probably the video you're looking for!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfcERas1WXI).

If you're trying to check sleeve size and/or quantity for you game check:

- [The BGG sleeve geeklist](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/164572/card-sleeve-sizes-games), the most compreensive sleeving size reference

- [Sleeve your games website](https://www.sleeveyourgames.com/), which is less compreensive but more convenient to search for.

This list is obviously incomplete, I'd like to try some other brands such as ultimate guard and swan pan. This is just a small reference guide.

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Penny sleeves, mayday standard, etc&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These sleeves are terrible. They are very loose on the cards, come out when shuffling, split often and have bad quality. They&amp;#39;re cheap but you get what you paid for.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;= 40&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1-2€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★☆☆☆☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;KMC perfect fit&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These sleeves are typically used for double sleeving but if you&amp;#39;re on a budget these are probably your best option. The sleeves are very fit to the card and don&amp;#39;t add much volume. They are leagues ahead the penny sleeves, typically cost twice as much. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s hard to find them on the cheap, I would recommend something else if you are gonna pay 4+ euros per pack&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;45&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2-4€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★★☆☆☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Mayday Premium&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These are my typical go-to sleeves. You can get them pretty much anywhere and they&amp;#39;ll get the job done. The cards sit comfortably on the sleeve, the thickness is good enough. Shuffle feel is a bit &amp;quot;rocky&amp;quot; but it&amp;#39;s okay. Some people complain about size consistency issues, personally never experienced them or noticed them.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;90&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4-6€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★★★☆☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Fantasy Flight  Games&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;These pretty much like the Mayday Premium, though they are a bit thicker. They tend to be slightly more expensive and they honestly feel the same to me so I tend to get Maydays instead.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;105&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4-7€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★★★☆☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Arcane Tinmen&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Some people say these sleeves have a great quality so I&amp;#39;m leaning to assume I got a &amp;quot;standard&amp;quot; version instead of a premium version. I tried their matte sleeves and they were terrible. Card wouldn&amp;#39;t stay in the sleeve, like a penny sleeve. Wouldn&amp;#39;t recommend that particular pack, maybe there&amp;#39;s a Premium version?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;80&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4-6€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★☆☆☆☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Ultra Pro&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;This brand makes a point of sticking an obnoxious hologram on their sleeves. I don&amp;#39;t wanna put the hologram on the back of the card because that will mark it, I don&amp;#39;t wanna put the hologram on the front of the card because it will get in the way. Seriously makes me avoid this brand as a whole. The sleeves are of similar quality to FFG, with same advantages and disadvantages + a hologram&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;100?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4-6€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★★★☆☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dragon Shield Matte&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;It&amp;#39;s very rare to find Matte transparent sleeves and I absolutely love Matte sleeves. It has a slightly &amp;quot;rugged&amp;quot; back which improves card grip (also makes it unsuitable for double-sided cards). These are by far my favorite sleeves right now, very thick, super solid quality, matte back, great shuffle feel. The one problem is price but you get what you paid for the quality is fantastic AND IT&amp;#39;S MATTE!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★★★★☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dragon Shield&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Dragon shield also carries a non-matte version. These are also of superior quality, I like to use them for double-sided cards such as cheat sheets. Again, very thick, super solid quality, great shuffle feel, price is unfortunately the problem.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;120&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★★★★☆&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;KMC Hyper Mat Translucent&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;I love the Dragon Shield Matte but the high price point made me try other brands, especially when a game has a lot of cards. KMC Hyper mat are an excellent alternative AND MATTE. I think these the absolute best price/quality sleeves. They provided a matte back, great shuffle feel, quality sleeves, no size inconsistencies. The shuffle feel is even better than dragon shield&amp;#39;s. The one problem is getting them, especially in Europe. I ordered them from japan at 2.5 euros per 80, most stores charge double...&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;??&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3-7€&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;★★★★★&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you were hoping to find non-transparent sleeves I will point you the Tolarian Community College&amp;#39;s youtube which has an excellent and exhaustive evaluation of pretty much every brand. &lt;a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfcERas1WXI""&gt;This is probably the video you&amp;#39;re looking for!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re trying to check sleeve size and/or quantity for you game check:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/164572/card-sleeve-sizes-games""&gt;The BGG sleeve geeklist&lt;/a&gt;, the most compreensive sleeving size reference&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.sleeveyourgames.com/""&gt;Sleeve your games website&lt;/a&gt;, which is less compreensive but more convenient to search for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is obviously incomplete, I&amp;#39;d like to try some other brands such as ultimate guard and swan pan. This is just a small reference guide. Hope if helps!&lt;/p&gt;

I purchased Clank A Deck-Building Adventure from Amazon (shipped and sold by Amazon) some time ago and after opening the box a few items caught my eye and I was under the impression I received a counterfeit due to receiving a scratched board, and spotting a few grammer errors in the manual.


After hearing so much wonderful news about board game customer service, and how great they are, I decided to reach out to customer support instead of returning the item to Amazon. 


Originally customer support went fine and followed a standard process which I was happy with. They asked some questions and I answered them and we came to the conclusion that what I believed to be grammer errors were in fact correct and a mistake in my original reading of the manual. They agreed to replace the dull scratched board with a new one as that must have been a manufacturing defect. 


Great I thought. I'm new to boardgaming and got a nostalgic itch after browsing target and purchasing a couple of games in which the family and I had a blast. I had so much fun I went and purchased about 40 different board games (overboard I know, but couldn't resist. Some games still sit unplayed) from different publishers after researching games at BGG. We now have a weekly board game night at home, and play any other chance we get. One thing I discovered is any game over a 2 in weight is a no go for my group. Thankfully games I purchased above that can be played solo or with at least 2 players.


A handful of games (or expansions) I purchased unfortunately came with a manufacturing defect. I reached out to each individual publisher to rectify the issue and all have been great. All responded quickly and sent replacement components in a timely manner. Their process was quick and simple with no hassles. Some I just explained the issue, others wanted pictures or a more detailed description. Best customer service I've received in a while and from different publishers. I couldn't believe it.


Except for Renegade Game Studios. They agreed to send the board and had all my info so I sat waiting patiently. After not receiving the replacement I followed up requesting an update or tracking number. This email has gone unanswered and I feel I will not receive a replacement and am being ignored. That said, it's possible my ticket was accidentally closed before shipping and my follow-up email was caught in a spam filter. They might have great customer support and I just fell through the cracks. 


During the wait we played Clank and loved it. Board wasn't in the best state but functional. I was highly considering the expansions, and In! Space! for something a little different, but before I dive in I would love to know your experience with the company. As much as we love the game I would not purchase another item from them if they do not back their products.


Thanks for reading and apologies for the long post. Really hope I'm just a one off. 

Also wanted to thank the community here for for all the fantastic posts and comments. You guys are the best, I love coming to this subreddit daily to read your thoughts, rankings, and opinions. Thank you! Without you I wouldn't have found some of my favorite games (or know that counterfeit board games exist. I no longer purchase from Amazon third parties)


TLDR: Received defective Clank! board, Renegade Game Studios customer support said they were sending me a replacement which I never received nor did they respond to my follow-up. Interested in expansions, however would like to hear from the community who dealt with their customer support how it went and if I just fell through the cracks before supporting them further.

I'm new to the sub here!

My girlfriend and I recently (about a month ago) started creating content for youtube. We'd sure appreciate you all checking it out!

I'm also excited to get chatting about games with you all!

Most recently we reviewed a new game called ""The Mind"" which has been a  ton of fun!

It's super simple, just trying to place numbered cards in numerical order, but the catch is that you cannot communicate whatsoever!

At first what seems like an unassuming game really comes in to it's own after a round or two, as you come to grips with the usage of ""throwing knives"" and the nature of timing.

We literally can't get enough of this game. So simple yet so fun!

The dice tower opened things up by saying it was amazing, then people bought into the hype, then I started seeing it on most overrated game lists…. I didn’t know what to think. For the record I usually DO NOT agree with Dice Tower assessments, so I was expecting to side with the more dissenting opinions. However……. I really liked it!

It’s a fantastic light area control game with a fun theme. I love area control games and I find they’re generally missing a bit of elegance for me to get them out regularly. This one was fun and simple and had enough variability to keep playing. I like the fixed 9 actions, I like the quality of the components with the strong vibrant colors. The game has depth when planning out your actions, but it’s simple enough even the most casual player can have fun. The most casual in our group had a huge smile on her face as she said “Oh I really like this!”.

I can see where people hate this game, but honestly if you want pure uncompromising determinism where you can play a game way more than other people and always win because of it just go play Chess. There are times where you’ll think “ok I’m going to try this!” and some card will kill your dudes or blow your ship or whatever. If you can’t handle that, then fine. Though it is a game of perfect information when it comes to taking actions. If you have a ship with 4/5 spots filled with your guys, and you’re thinking of making that amazing play where you play the pilot card to change the destination of the ship to the best territory (But it’s last in initiative order) you’re an idiot if you think that’s going to work lol. You know if the other players still have their “Destroy a ship” card and you know this is the perfect time to do it. So play a card higher in initiative that 5, launch your ship to the “Less desirable” territory, and leave your opponents with a tough decision on what ship they have to blow up now. I can see people playing a low initiative card and then getting salty when “shockingly” another player plays a higher initiative card that countered the obvious play they were setting up. We all know those type of gamers……….

All in all the game is great casual fun, and that means it’s worth owning. I will gladly show this to anyone of any gaming skill level and feel confident they will understand it quickly and we can all have a laugh as we launch cute little Astromeeples to Mars and watch them bound about trying to get the best resources. The casual people will feel like they know perfectly well what’s going on, the people who want to think ahead can plan out possibilities with cards that are still in hand, and initiative order and probability (And probably still come out ahead). The randomness of ‘player decisions’ (Not dice or cards) create a chaotic set of circumstances that sometimes result in a mess of things, but it’s just all so much fun.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’d heard a lot of mixed opinions on Mission Red Planet.

BattleCON captures the fast-paced head-to-head intensity of a 2D fighting video game and tempers it with the strategic decision-making of a card game. Imagine Street Fighter, Guilty Gear, Mortal Kombat, or King of Fighters for your kitchen table!  Mechanically, it is a 2-player open-information fighting game focusing on spacing, tactical planning, and reading the opponent.  Every turn, players will make attacks, modify their pairs after they're set, and revealed simultaneously.

The latest expansion (and supposedly final on kickstarter) is being called BattleCON Ultimate and it is a mixture of a new set (Wanderers) and support for existing products.

Key features:

* Rebalance of Devastation of Indines (BattleCON's largest set) to play better with Fate/War/Trials (looking at you, Ottavia/Arec)
* Wanderers of Indines, a set of 10 new characters designed by fans
* Both of above come with tuckboxes and extra bases similar to Trials3
* Updates to Trials/War/Fate
* Art and lore book of Indines
* Storage container

Kickstarter ends in 30 days (10/22)

Instead of doing ""get X likes on Facebook"" or something similar, L99 Games wants you to submit your content: fanfiction, fanart, cosplays, guides, custom fighters on the Boardgamegeek forums.  Per the Kickstarter,  each backer may make one submission in each of the six categories below to unlock fighters:

* **Fanfic** \- Post an original fan-fiction on fanfiction.net or the blog of your choice featuring at least one World of Indines character!
* **Fan Art** \- Post an original sketch or full illustration of any World of Indines character on a blog, art site, or social media.
* **Cosplay** \- Post a picture of an original World of Indines character cosplay on a blog, art site, or social media.
* **Fighter Custom -** Post your own unique fighter kit on [boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/18031/battlecon), [/r/BattleCON](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlecon/), or another fan community of your choice!
* **Event** \- Host an Organized Play Event for BattleCON at your local game store or other public venue. Take some pictures of your event and share them on social media!
* **Guide** \- Write a fighter guide on [boardgamegeek.com](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/18031/battlecon), [/r/BattleCON](https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlecon/), the steam discussion forums or a favorite site of your own!

&lt;p&gt;The latest expansion (and supposedly final on kickstarter) is being called BattleCON Ultimate and it is a mixture of a new set (Wanderers) and support for existing products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key features:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rebalance of Devastation of Indines (BattleCON&amp;#39;s largest set) to play better with Fate/War/Trials (looking at you, Ottavia/Arec)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wanderers of Indines, a set of 10 new characters designed by fans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Both of above come with tuckboxes and extra bases similar to Trials3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Updates to Trials/War/Fate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Art and lore book of Indines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Storage container&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kickstarter ends in 30 days (10/22)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Edit&lt;/em&gt;:  I forgot the most important part.  Instead of doing &amp;quot;get X likes on Facebook&amp;quot; or something similar, L99 Games wants you to submit your content: fanfiction, fanart, cosplays, guides, custom fighters on the Boardgamegeek forums.  Per the Kickstarter,  each backer may make one submission in each of the six categories below to unlock fighters:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fanfic&lt;/strong&gt; - Post an original fan-fiction on fanfiction.net or the blog of your choice featuring at least one World of Indines character!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fan Art&lt;/strong&gt; - Post an original sketch or full illustration of any World of Indines character on a blog, art site, or social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosplay&lt;/strong&gt; - Post a picture of an original World of Indines character cosplay on a blog, art site, or social media.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fighter Custom -&lt;/strong&gt; Post your own unique fighter kit on &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/18031/battlecon""&gt;boardgamegeek.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlecon/""&gt;/r/BattleCON&lt;/a&gt;, or another fan community of your choice!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Event&lt;/strong&gt; - Host an Organized Play Event for BattleCON at your local game store or other public venue. Take some pictures of your event and share them on social media!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Guide&lt;/strong&gt; - Write a fighter guide on &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/18031/battlecon""&gt;boardgamegeek.com&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlecon/""&gt;/r/BattleCON&lt;/a&gt;, the steam discussion forums or a favorite site of your own!&lt;/li&gt;

Just wanted to share some heart-warming board game pride and joy with you all! With the start of a new school year comes our first year anniversary of our school's Board Game Club, and it's been a huge success so far! 

&amp;nbsp;

For a little background, our school specialises in social, emotional and mental health issues for children aged 9-16 - many of whom either live with complex special needs (ASC, ADHD, FASD, bipolar, etc), or are from some pretty damn messy home backgrounds. It all started after I showed some kids in my class Exploding Kittens in an attempt to persuade them away from the PCs during their free time; a game I eventually had to leave in our classroom because of how in demand it was during breaktimes. This very quickly snowballed from me having to bring new games and introduce new classes to them due to popular request, into 20-odd teenagers petitioning our School Council for a dedicated after-school Board Games Club. Guess who the headteacher approached to ask about volunteering to run it? :P

&amp;nbsp;

Now I must be honest, I originally expected it to be a bit of a novelty thing that would gradually dwindle in numbers, but noooope. Since starting it, I've had to increase the number of days it runs, started up a sister ""Dungeons &amp; Dragons"" club that an autistic 16-year old pupil DMs for us (and very well, I must add!!), and spent way too many hours / personal funds prowling game shops online and offline looking for new things that the kids might be interested in. It's been an absolute pleasure watching these kids refuse time on the Xboxes and Playstations after-school in favour of playing games around the table, alongside other kids irrespective of age, class, special need or ability. I think one of my fondest memories in particular since this club started was watching an incredibly quiet and socially anxious 15-year old girl coach a hyperactive 10-year old boy in Cluedo, which quickly became one of their favourite regular games to play together.

&amp;nbsp;

With the new year starting, I'm looking to bump up our collection of games a little bit - particularly focusing on *variety* to appeal to our 9-16 aged boys and girls of *seriously* varying interests and abilities. I'm a pretty geeky teaching assistant with a fondness for video, board and card games of all types and genres, so I've been able to sustain the club mostly with my own personal games collection (with a few classics here and there provided by the school), but **I'd be more than grateful for some sound second opinions about new recommendations from your wonderful selves!**

&amp;nbsp;

For reference, these are the games (that I remember off the top of my head) that we currently rotate in our collection, with those emboldened probably being our most popular.

&amp;nbsp;

* **The Resistance**
* **Dungeons &amp; Dragons**
* **Exploding Kittens**
* **Bears versus Babies**
* **Dobble**
* **Uno**
* **Jenga**
* **King of Tokyo**
* **Munchkin**
* **Pitchcar Mini**
* **Go Go Gelato!**
* **TIME Stories**
* **The UNLOCK! Series**
* Cluedo
* Chess
* Standard Playing Card games - Rummy, Cheat, Go Fish, etc.
* Carcassonne
* Forbidden Island
* Pandemic
* Labyrinth
* Codenames
* Deception: Murder in Hong Kong
* Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective (although I do have to try and make it a little easier for our lot, haha).
* Love Letter
* Payday

&amp;nbsp;

Easy to set up, simple to teach, short round games are definitely the most ideal for us! The club lasts just under 2 hours, but that includes set-up and pack-down time, and let's say a good chunk of our kids ... well, aren't exactly blessed with the largest of attention spans either, haha. They can also get a little over-competitive and giddy sometimes, which is super cute in terms of their enthusiasm and excitement, but can sometimes result in damaged pieces and cards (even sleeved), so my wallet would definitely prefer games on the lower end of the price scale! :P

&lt;li&gt;Carcassonne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forbidden Island&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Labyrinth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Codenames&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deception: Murder in Hong Kong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective (although I do have to try and make it a little easier for our lot, haha).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love Letter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Payday&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Easy to set up, simple to teach, short round games are definitely the most ideal for us! The club lasts just under 2 hours, but that includes set-up and pack-down time, and let&amp;#39;s say a good chunk of our kids ... well, aren&amp;#39;t exactly blessed with the largest of attention spans either, haha. They can also get a little over-competitive and giddy sometimes, which is super cute in terms of their enthusiasm and excitement, but can sometimes result in damaged pieces and cards (even sleeved), so my wallet would definitely prefer games on the lower end of the price scale! :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long-winded post, and thank you so much! You&amp;#39;re certainly my favourite subreddit to lurk, haha. ♥&lt;/p&gt;

Now I just moved to Berlin so it was finally time to get a Kallax to make my humble collection more presentable. For game nights I tend to enjoy heavier games (and with time going by, more Euros), but with bigger groups of friends we sometimes also play party games.

My current favorites are:

\- Twilight Imperium 4 Ed.  
\- Twilight Struggle  
\- Hansa Teutonica  
\- Klask

If you're a Berliner and would like to get together for some games, hit me up! A couple of my friends love to play as well, but since I just got here, I haven't yet started a regular group.

Ordered/Kickstarted but not yet arrived (mostly due to waiting for the German version):

\- Gloomhaven  
\- Spirit Island  
\- 7th Continent  
\- Escape Plan  
\- Lisboa  
\- Pax Pamir 2nd Ed.

Games I'm planning on getting are, in descending order or relevance:

\- A Feast for Odin  
\- Gaia Project  
\- Yellow and Yangtze  
\- Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective  
\- Fenris for Scythe (I don't like Scythe that much, but hope that this expansion will be worth it. What do you think?)  
\- Letters from Whitechapel

Otherwise I wouldn't change a thing. I sold all games that I don't enjoy to play (besides Scythe b/c of Fenris and Colt Express as my gateway game into this world due to nostalgia), so I'm down for anything to play in the picture.  


I'd love to hear your thoughts, criticism and/or recommendations!

It's a nice visual to see all the games and links to videos the creator made. You can also click into the game to see all the videos for that associated game. I'll be adding more features to associate more videos with each game in the future. I'm even hoping to have a filter in the advanced search for search by channel name.

Today’s giveaway comes to us courtesy of **[Gamelyn Games](https://www.gamelyngames.com/)**, best known for the Tiny Epic series, and who have a Kickstarter running RIGHT NOW for **[Tiny Epic Mechs](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/coe/tiny-epic-mechs-mechanized-entertainment-combat-he)**. 

Gamelyn has generously donated the following prizes:

* 2 copies of **[Tiny Epic Zombies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/244536/tiny-epic-zombies)** and a playmat for each, fresh off its recent Kickstarter delivery. 
* A copy of **[Tiny Epic Galaxies](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/163967/tiny-epic-galaxies)**, along with the **Beyond the Black** expansion, playmats for each, and a Gamelyn plushie! 

##To enter

To be eligible to win, you *must have previously commented in /r/boardgames prior to Sept. 15*.

To enter, all you have to do is *leave a top-level comment* answering the following question:

**What's the oldest game in your collection or group that still sees regular play?**

Winners will be randomly selected from qualifying comments.

##Shipping

This giveaway will ship WORLDWIDE. Thanks again to Gamelyn for their generosity. 

##The fine print

These giveaways are open until 5:30 a.m. Pacific time the day after they are posted. Comments made after 5:30 a.m. will not be eligible to win. Each day, I will make a new post announcing the winners of the previous day’s giveaway. They will be tagged in the post, and notified via private message. WINNERS WILL HAVE 48 HOURS TO RESPOND. If you don’t expect to be able to log in for two days after a giveaway, *please do not enter*. If a winner does not respond within 48 hours, another winner will be selected.

To simplify things for the companies who have donated prizes (and to help prevent the same person winning multiple prizes), I will be collecting shipping information and passing it on to the donors. This will include collecting a valid name and shipping address, and in some cases, a phone number. If you aren’t comfortable providing this information, *please do not enter*. 

Anyone caught attempting to game the system by leaving multiple comments in a single post will be disqualified from this and all subsequent giveaways. If you’re eligible for two giveaways in a single day, you may enter both, though we ask you to consider your level of interest in the specific prizes before doing so, out of consideration for those who may be eligible for only one giveaway.

Before anyone accuses the mod team of being too /r/hailcorporate,  we were not contacted by any of these companies for any form of publicity. In fact, everyone who replied to our outreach was exceptionally cool about the whole thing, and grateful to /r/boardgames for the community we provide. This is not the time to disparage or air grievances with the company providing the prizes for this giveaway.

Mods are *not eligible* to win any of these giveaways.

I’ll be turning notifications off on this post, in order to prevent a relentless barrage of orangereds, so if you have additional questions, please [contact us via modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fboardgames), or send me a PM.

And now, here are the winners, along with their answers to the giveaway question:

* /u/Ace_Wolfe wins a copy of **Twilight Struggle** from GMT Games, along with a collector’s-edition copy of the latest issue of C3i Magazine.

&gt; Like many others, space is one of my favorites. Cosmic Encounters, Galaxy Trucker, Race for the Galaxy, heck I even like the XCom board game.

* /u/FailingHappenstance wins a copy of **Dominant Species** from GMT Games, along with a collector’s-edition copy of the latest issue of C3i Magazine.

&gt; I think space or industry. Space in terms of space ships, mars, anything to deal with it. Industry kinda coincides with Space a lot (terraforming mars), but I also enjoy just down to earth industry games like Brass and Power Grid.

* /u/timbone316 wins a copy of **Nyctophobia**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; Definitely retro sci fi. Unfortunately, not many games at all cater to it (Rayguns and Rocketships comes to mind), but that is a theme I love. Why aren't there more board games with that aesthetic?

* /u/DarthOtter wins a copy of **Nyctophobia**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I do love the sci fi theme, but my favourites are mash ups or weird variations on the science fiction theme.

* /u/Doc_Faust wins a copy of **Nyctophobia**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I quite like the theme of Tokaido, mostly because of the way it manifests. ""Try to have a great vacation, and make sure all your friends have the worst vacation possible.""

* /u/cptstnkpnts wins a copy of **Dinosaur Island**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; Anything but Cthulu. It's been done to death in the board gaming world.

* /u/Syhra wins a copy of **Dinosaur Island**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I love exploration! That feeling of discovery and adventure. I particularly enjoy games with modular/randomized setup.

&gt; Some exploration-ish games I play are 7th Continent, Escape:Curse of the Temple, and Forbidden Desert.

* /u/dyzzy wins a copy of **Dinosaur Island**, courtesy of Pandasaurus Games.

&gt; I know it's cliche, but I love Lovecraft. I've played far too many bad games with Cthulhu stapled onto them.

I'll be reaching out to the winners via PM. Thanks to the more than 2,000 of you who participated, and keep an eye out for more giveaways in the days ahead!

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

Incan Gold is a quick, fun and tense game in which you and other adventurers explore an old Incan temple in search of gold and treasure.  In each of the five rounds, you secretly choose if you want to continue exploring the temple in search of more treasure or retreat to the safety of your camp with your share of the treasure that has been discovered so far.

Each time that an explorer braves new territory, more treasure or a danger appears.  When a second card of the same type of danger is turned over, all exposed treasure is buried, leaving the remaining adventurers with nothing.  Do you flee the dangerous temple with your portion of the treasure that has been uncovered so far or do you venture into the exciting temple in search of more hidden valuables?

After five rounds of exploration, whoever has the most treasure is the ultimate explorer and winner!

From the publisher:  ""You and your fellow adventurers travel to Peru to find a ruined Incan temple and its treasures:  turquoise, obsidian, and gold.  There are also rumors of valuable Incan artifacts.  Will you chance dangers like giant spiders, mummies, and fire during your search, or will you escape back to camp and safety, carrying out your loot?""
