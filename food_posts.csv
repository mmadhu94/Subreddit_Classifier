Let me be clear, I'm not sure if this is a consensus or even an highly shared opinion. I think The Dice Tower mentioned this a few times, maybe that gave me the impression that the community had the same opinion. 

Anyway, I bring the subject because I always thought **Race** was the easier game to teach. It seems so much straightforward in comparison to me. 5 phases, each player simultaneously choose which to activate, and they're all pretty easy to teach by themselves. Then comes the iconography which some people blow out of proportion (usually, it's the main argument given when arguing that **Race** is a hassle to teach.) I don't get why though. There's barely any variety in the symbols used and the more esoteric ones have a textual explanation on the card itself.

On the other hand, I find that **Roll** is a bit harder to teach, not much but still. I guess I feel the dice assignment is less intuitive gameplay-wise than just selecting an action from your hand, i.e. selecting one main action with your dice and potentially other secondary actions compared to just choosing a card in your hand.

I have a group of around 40 close friends that I invite every other week to a game night I host. I started collecting board games in May 2018 after I got my promotion at work. I’ve been buying a bunch of games that I see on Game the Game of Tabletop that I thought looked enjoyable. We’ve only had 3 game nights to this point but I noticed a small problem

We usually have too many people. Sometimes someone is sitting out. We have had attendance of 6, 9, 5 at game nights since we started hosting. The second night was difficult as I have games for that many people like Secret Hitler, Formula D, Tsuro (which we had the loser sit out but then someone said they were tired and went home so it worked out). 

I offered to split the group so that we had more diversity and I’d play two games at once that way I could help both groups with the rules but people didn’t seem to want to do that. Most of the games I have are for 5-6 players at most. 

So the big question here is, how do I get people who may want to split off into different groups to player smaller games so that we can have more diversity during game night. A lot of people, I feel, want to try a new game to sample what they like, but are afraid to mess up the rules. I also think that as people start to come “regularly” (I.e only 3 people have been to all 3 game nights so far) they will start to learn the games they like and then want to play those games instead.

## What this is:

 This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

 All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

 Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

We played three scenes (opening, branch, and closing) with one judge and 4 players.  All 3 scenes had the glider enemy and the final scene also had the swamp choir boss.  In the first two scenes, the heroes won (or at least rendered the encounter impossible to lose) by taking out a lot of gliders very quickly - between the gliders' affinity for attacking in groups and the Sage's ability to attack every monster in a range, the heroes made quick work of their foes and left the judge with few options.  The third scene, but contrast, was lost almost immediately when the swamp choir found the tokens it needed before most of the heroes could even reach it.

While I loved a lot of things about the game, the actual balance left me deeply unsatisfied.  It's true that every scene was so one-sided due mostly to good/bad luck in set up and opening hands, but what are the odds that that would happen three scenes in a row?  Are the scenes themselves inherently unbalanced?  Were we as a group just super unlucky?

So I guess I'm asking, have other Thornwatch players...
(a) felt like the game was unbalanced and scenes were one-sided?
(b) felt like this was due to ""unexpected randomness?""
(c) changed any rules to make things more balances?

*I'm defining ""unexpected randomness"" as something like ""a player starts draws the right cards at the right time.""  This is compared to ""expected/known randomness"" such as rolling the die, since the die has a consistent, predictable outcome that's been more deliberately designed and balanced, whereas there's no way to expect/account for the stars aligning in a given player's hand.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;My gaming group just played Thornwatch for the first time, and I wanted to know if other people had a similar experience, and if so if they tried modifying any rules.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I loved a lot of things about the game, the actual balance left me deeply unsatisfied.  It&amp;#39;s true that every scene was so one-sided due mostly to good/bad luck in set up and opening hands, but what are the odds that that would happen three scenes in a row?  Are the scenes themselves inherently unbalanced?  Were we as a group just super unlucky?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I&amp;#39;m asking, have other Thornwatch players...
(a) felt like the game was unbalanced and scenes were one-sided?
(b) felt like this was due to &amp;quot;unexpected randomness?&amp;quot;
(c) changed any rules to make things more balances?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*I&amp;#39;m defining &amp;quot;unexpected randomness&amp;quot; as something like &amp;quot;a player starts draws the right cards at the right time.&amp;quot;  This is compared to &amp;quot;expected/known randomness&amp;quot; such as rolling the die, since the die has a consistent, predictable outcome that&amp;#39;s been more deliberately designed and balanced, whereas there&amp;#39;s no way to expect/account for the stars aligning in a given player&amp;#39;s hand.&lt;/p&gt;

This game is intended to be Kickstarted in October 2018, however the game is still undergoing some significant game-balance revision. I have permission from Alex at GFG to discuss the game (see [my BGG thread](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2052868/preview-beta-test-reavers-midgard) on the same), but I'm not going to post an exhaustive manual of the game in this space given its beta status (nor do I want to share anything approaching IP). I've seen enough to tell you what Reavers of Midgard (RoM) is, and I'll explain it by comparing it to other popular games, including its spiritual predecessor, Champions of Midgard (CoM).

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary of RoM**

*Players:* 2 to 5, but I think 4 players is the intended best? There is chatter of some solo rules, but nothing I've seen playtested

*Chief Mechanics:* Resource management (moderate), set completion, drafting, simple worker placement, synergy. There's not enough combat in the current version to justify that keyword, unlike CoM.

*Weight (BGG scale):* If Puerto Rico is a 3.29, and Terra Mystica is a 3.95, then the current incarnation of RoM is about a 3.4 to 3.5. Yes, that's significantly heavier than CoM's 2.53.

*Describe RoM in a tweet:* Recruit Reaver cards and warrior dice, then deploy them to conquer territories, raid keeps, and battle at sea! Collect special abilities to improve your strategy, and sets of rewards for increasing Glory!

&amp;#x200B;

**The ""Feel"" of Playing RoM**

Like CoM, the theme of RoM is of competing Viking bands who enrich themselves and defend the homeland from threats. The playtest version of course didn't have the assistance of art to capture the theme of the actions, but the result is that, when you declare a Battle action or a Recruit action or a Trade, everyone participates if they are able, but as the leader of that action you will get the choicest spoils, and your peers that are ill-equipped to join you on your exploits won't get their share.

&amp;#x200B;

RoM is technically a ""worker placement"" game, but the phrase is more true of CoM than this one; you get one worker, and you are essentially choosing one of six locations on the board. You'll be first to complete the actions instructed and nab the resources there, but then the other players will take the same action, in order, with diminishing returns. In this respect, the game mimics **Puerto Rico's** phase drafting, but represents it with worker placement on the board. However, opponents that do not have the required resources cannot participate in the same action, so plotting certain actions while your opponent is unable to share in the gains is strategically necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll spend the game ultimately trying to acquire victory points (""Glory""), some of which are scored immediately, and some of which are tallied at the end of the game. To do so, you will acquire other resources that you will spend to gain said Glory. Some resources are simple, such as food, which is required to participate in some actions such as Raiding Keeps. Some resources are complex, such as the Reaver cards and the warrior dice that you draft. There are six locations on the board, and all of them involve gaining resources and/or cards and dice.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example board location, the ""Raid Keeps"" action, which has the following steps:

1. Spend 3 food and 2 shield dice
2. Draft a column of Spoils cards
3. Draw bonus Spoils cards (2/1/0/0/0)

&amp;#x200B;

Being your action during the Turn, you place your worker on the Raid Keeps location. You spend the food and dice required, then you choose one of three vertical columns of Spoils cards to take. Let's say you see one card with a matching icon to one you've already collected, so you draft that column for increasingly larger set completion bonuses. Finally, you draw two bonus Spoils cards from the top of the deck.

&amp;#x200B;

Your opponent to your left doesn't have enough food or dice to participate (which you knew), so she must ""pass"", instead drafting one warrior die of her choice. The next opponent does spend the food and dice, and drafts one of the remaining columns of Spoils cards. He then draws 1 bonus Spoils card as shown by the numbers in the slashes. The last opponent in a four-player game also spends the food and dice, opts for a single Spoils card from the deck (an alternative to the remaining column of Spoils cards), and then gets no bonus cards as shown by the slash numbers. This ends your action and the player on your left now places their worker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Warrior Dice, Reavers, and Comparisons to CoM**

In CoM, the primary mechanic is the warrior dice, which are worth nothing at the end of the game, but are committed to battle in order to (hopefully) defeat monsters for glory, set bonuses, and more resources and dice.

&amp;#x200B;

In RoM, dice behave differently: you roll the dice when *drafted*, not in combat. The faceup side of the die defines that warrior's role or particular training; you need Shield dice or Boat dice or Hammer dice, etc. to complete certain actions. The colors of the dice pertain to the possible outcomes of the die when you draft and roll it (i.e. blue dice can't roll Shields, but are the only dice to roll Trees). You simply spend dice as required, although occasionally you may be permitted to reroll one or more dice.

&amp;#x200B;

The primary mechanic in RoM are the namesake Reaver cards, which are like lieutenants for your warriors. These are gained via the Recruit Reavers action. When you draft a Reaver card, you gain several warrior dice as well, and this is the chief method to gain dice in the game. With this Reaver card, you can use it in three ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You can discard it to your endgame pile. Doing so provides you with bonus warrior dice indicated by the card.
2. You can place it in the leader side of your boat, the large card where you organize your resources and abilities. This bumps the former Reaver card into your endgame pile. The color of the Reaver indicates that dice *of that color* you possess are now ""wild"" and can be spent as any symbol on the die in certain circumstances. You also gain one of three rewards each time you promote a new Reaver, so you may prefer that benefit to the dice gained by discarding it.
3. Instead of the above, you can assign the Reaver to one of several ""engines"" at the bottom of your boat, which correspond to certain board actions, such as Raid Keeps. Whenever you complete the corresponding action, each Reaver card triggers a unique benefit printed on the card (for example, ""Draw a free Spoils card"").

&amp;#x200B;

**Maybe Not Heavy, Just Complex**

RoM isn't the kind of ""heavy"" where it overwhelms the player with myriad possible actions. Instead, RoM is the kind of game where it may not always be clear what the most profitable rewards are. Whereas in CoM the monsters were worth a static amount of points on the card plus a bonus for color sets, a reward set in RoM could be worth, say 1/3/6/10/15. So gaining a fifth card of the matching type is worth five points, but the sixth is worth only one point as you're starting a new set. While resources are worth little or no points after the game, it can be difficult determining which cards on the board may be ""worth"" the most to you. I'm not sure if its intentionally a complicated flux or marketplace, or my own inexperience with a game still under construction. It could also be a playtesting competition, to see which rewards players most enjoy to seek.

&amp;#x200B;

Many games choose to narrow the options to thematically and tactically reduce viable strategies, as well as shorten the game and force a resolution; instead, RoM seems to invite a large number of hybrid tactics and perhaps prevent competitive stymies. While in CoM you can take the best of two sources of a resource on the board, in Reavers there seems to be three ways to get every kind of resource, except the Reavers cards themselves and the static Sea Battle cards. Likewise, you're never swimming in resources (unless you do it intentionally), and you don't have to resource to accounting practices to track them.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's my assumption that RoM is intended to be a less directly-competitive, more ""personal sandbox"" style of worker placement/resource management game. This is one of the few games where it would take a concerted effort by the other players to keep you from getting something you clearly want; you're mostly likely to be stymied be others merely taking the card you want or the action you wanted or weren't prepared for. RoM seems a good game for those who might want to dabble in the marketplace at hand, reacting to the choices of other players and choosing simple strategies; however, players who successfully execute engine-building strategies and exploit special abilities will consistently outperform those players.

&amp;#x200B;

(This incarnation of) Reavers of Midgard is more of a Euro-style point-grab than its predecessor, with fewer ways to thwart your opponents' tactics than most.

The color of the Reaver indicates that dice &lt;em&gt;of that color&lt;/em&gt; you possess are now &amp;quot;wild&amp;quot; and can be spent as any symbol on the die in certain circumstances. You also gain one of three rewards each time you promote a new Reaver, so you may prefer that benefit to the dice gained by discarding it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of the above, you can assign the Reaver to one of several &amp;quot;engines&amp;quot; at the bottom of your boat, which correspond to certain board actions, such as Raid Keeps. Whenever you complete the corresponding action, each Reaver card triggers a unique benefit printed on the card (for example, &amp;quot;Draw a free Spoils card&amp;quot;).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Maybe Not Heavy, Just Complex&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RoM isn&amp;#39;t the kind of &amp;quot;heavy&amp;quot; where it overwhelms the player with myriad possible actions. Instead, RoM is the kind of game where it may not always be clear what the most profitable rewards are. Whereas in CoM the monsters were worth a static amount of points on the card plus a bonus for color sets, a reward set in RoM could be worth, say 1/3/6/10/15. So gaining a fifth card of the matching type is worth five points, but the sixth is worth only one point as you&amp;#39;re starting a new set. While resources are worth little or no points after the game, it can be difficult determining which cards on the board may be &amp;quot;worth&amp;quot; the most to you. I&amp;#39;m not sure if its intentionally a complicated flux or marketplace, or my own inexperience with a game still under construction. It could also be a playtesting competition, to see which rewards players most enjoy to seek.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many games choose to narrow the options to thematically and tactically reduce viable strategies, as well as shorten the game and force a resolution; instead, RoM seems to invite a large number of hybrid tactics and perhaps prevent competitive stymies. While in CoM you can take the best of two sources of a resource on the board, in Reavers there seems to be three ways to get every kind of resource, except the Reavers cards themselves and the static Sea Battle cards. Likewise, you&amp;#39;re never swimming in resources (unless you do it intentionally), and you don&amp;#39;t have to resource to accounting practices to track them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So it&amp;#39;s my assumption that RoM is intended to be a less directly-competitive, more &amp;quot;personal sandbox&amp;quot; style of worker placement/resource management game. This is one of the few games where it would take a concerted effort by the other players to keep you from getting something you clearly want; you&amp;#39;re mostly likely to be stymied be others merely taking the card you want or the action you wanted or weren&amp;#39;t prepared for. RoM seems a good game for those who might want to dabble in the marketplace at hand, reacting to the choices of other players and choosing simple strategies; however, players who successfully execute engine-building strategies and exploit special abilities will consistently outperform those players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(This incarnation of) Reavers of Midgard is more of a Euro-style point-grab than its predecessor, with fewer ways to thwart your opponents&amp;#39; tactics than most. If you&amp;#39;re looking for a points-race game where opponents can&amp;#39;t perpetually trip each other up, then watch for this game to be Kickstarted in October.&lt;/p&gt;

* Popularity is important, but not the only factor in winning. I managed to get up to 17 popularity, but as I did not have a large amount of territories I only managed a middle of the pack score.

* Coins can be important. The winning player chose the factory card which generates 3 coins, and then spammed the move. He ended up with 27 coins at the end of the game, which gave him the win by 10ish coins.

* You dont always have to win combat. Again the winning player spread out his units to control a large amount of territories, then once he was setup, used a tunnel to begin combat with the player who was closest to 5 stars. He then bid 0 combat power, giving the white player a star, and then the white player ended the game on their next go by placing their 4th building.

While I was there one of the guys had a game and I want to know the name so I can buy it and play it again.

Here are the few things I can remember about how it was played so.

It started with tiles in which you randomly placed to make a ""game board"" you then had multiple monsters that were made out of like cardboard that you added to a little plastic stand for them. And you placed them on the board that you made (anywhere if I remember correctly) then you had cards matching the monsters and you each drew a card (maybe 3 I think) and they matched monsters on the board but the other players didn't know who you had and then you each took turns moving the monsters one space at a time and if they met on the same square tile that monster ""died"" and was set aside untill only one was left and the goal was to try and keep the monster that matched your card alive till the end and then that person got the points for that round. Once someone won you could choose to move the tiles around to make a different looking map or ""game board"" also turn the cards back in and shuffle and grab new card. 

Few more details was I think the tiles that made up the game board were two sided. The tiles were also like some sort of dungeon. 2 players were the least but I know that when we played it we had 4 players I'm not sure if any more than that could play but I don't remember.

Ok, so my turn 1: I get clank+2 and so I put my clank in the clank area but not in the bag.
Dragon attack: so now my clanks get put in the bag. That is clear.

Alternative turn 1: I get clank+1 and a clank -2 so I dont get to carry the extra -1 because the rules say you lose any unused -clanks at the end of you turn. Nothing goes in the area. That is clear too.

But, let's say turn 1: +2 clank. They go in the clank area but not in the bag as I've not had a dragon attack yet.
My Turn 2: I get -1 clank but don't generate any clank on that turn, can I use that -1 clank to get one of the clanks back from the clank area? It's not got in the bag yet as there hasn't been a dragon attack, and I'm not carrying my -clank over to the next go.

Don't think it changes the game hugely but I just had one of those ""shit, I wonder if I've been playing it wrong this whole time"" moments. It's not even a complicated book but I've lost the rulebook a while ago and only now started wondering!

I have spent quite a bit on Kickstarter in the last five years, something to the tune of $6000 or $7000 over 169 projects. 

Just to be clear, this was all disposable income, so it didn't hurt me in any way. About 90% was on board games, the rest on tech and comics/graphic novels.

Looking over Starcadia Quest, I just felt plain old nothing. Not one ounce of me wanted to drop $120 on the ""base pledge"", i.e. the one that you really should get, since it comes with SO MUCH MORE COOL STUFF than the $80 actual base pledge. I already have retail Arcadia Quest and Inferno with all the goodies, now you want me to buy MORE???

I have so many games (\~200), and to be honest, my all time favorite games have almost never come from Kickstarter. What games do I rate a 9 or a 10? Games like Agricola/Caverna, Pandemic, Descent 2.0, Stone Age, Dominion, T'Zolkin, Glory to Rome, 7 Wonders: Duels, LOTR: LCG,  

I should note the few games that I have received from Kickstarter and were fantasic. Stonemeier Games really does come through, I'm almost sad Jamie has given up Kickstarter. I love Viticulture with Tuscany, Euphoria (for all of it's flaws), and Scythe. Between Two Cities is good, though not in the same tier as the three I mentioned.

King's Forge,  Eminent Domain, Evolution, Through the Ages (2nd Edition), Myth: Dark Frontier,  were also totally worth the purchase and the wait. The other 135ish board games? Honestly, I could probably do without them.

The issue might of course be me...I have a family, a toddler, two older kids that love playing games with me, but at 9 and 13 they can only do so much with the time we have together (every other weekend and one weeknight). When I do get together for games, it's not a 3 hour epic.

And yet, I purchased quite a few games that maybe I didn't need. Heck, I just backed Death May Die because I love the Mythos and things Cthulu.

I'm curious if anyone shares my current dislike of too much plastic on Kickstarter, if you find yourself buying games you might end up never playing, or if you just want to share your favorite games from Kickstarter.

Also, take away the lesson that Kickstarter will very rarely leave you content. There is ALWAYS something more to buy. There is ALWAYS another project with Kickstarter exclusives. I don't object to Kiskstarter as a whole, but at the end of the day it will work out in your favor to just wait for things to come to retail and be reviewed.

&amp;#x200B;

You know how many games CMON has put out that are critcally acclaimed? My anecdotal experience says just one: Blood Rage. The rest are just recycled dice chuckers with a ton of plastic to get you to buy.

&lt;p&gt;Full disclosure, this is a topic we are going to tackle in our next episode of &lt;a href=""http://www.cardboardherald.com/tcbh-hangouts""&gt;TCbH Hangouts&lt;/a&gt; (our smallest and most casual feed on &lt;a href=""http://www.cardboardherald.com""&gt;The Cardboard Herald&lt;/a&gt;), but I thought it warranted some genuine discussion with the hobby at large.&lt;/p&gt;

Ordered through Amazon from Amazon. Best option?**


I purchased Spirit Island through Amazon (initially thought GTG was the seller) and, after several plays, noticed a [misprinted card](https://imgur.com/a/t9DPd5n). 

If it wasn't an invader card it wouldn't be a big deal, but now I know those invaders want my sands and mountains and my poor, beautiful Dahan. I love my Dahan. Of course, I'm going to preempt that exploration if I can keep all of the moves straight in my head.

So, this card hasn't actually come up yet. I've only played the base difficulty and my friend and I typically take things down right before the level 3 invaders, but I know it's coming at some point. Per some other thread, I've emailed craig@greaterthangames with no reply yet (it's only been 5 days). 

* Will they replace the card? 
* Should I just return the whole thing to Amazon and order a new one even though this one has been played a few times?
* Is Branch and Claw that divisive?
* What's your favorite spirit from the base game?

These are the questions rattling in my mind. Unending. Dramatically. Invaderously.

To be clear, I'm using ""casual"" tournament to distinguish from something like the national Catan tournament at Origins.  A casual tournament is played entirely at a single convention. There are no qualifiers, so anyone who knows the rules to the game can play since the rules won't be taught. Games are usually spread out across the duration of the con, and joining a game does not require you to commit to any more games; you can play in just one round if you want.  Casual tournament games are usually listed in the event list alongside all the other scheduled games, but with a designation that this game counts for tournament scoring.  After all rounds have finished, the players with the highest win count are invited back for the semis/finals, and the final winner might get a plaque or something. No title, no status.  If you've ever been to WBC, this is the kind of tournament I'm talking about.

Having been to a few conventions with this tournament structure, it seems that different attendees have different reasons for signing up or not signing up for these tournament games. Some people say they don't like the ""tournament"" designation.  Some people like the competitive aspect, while others don't even care and just show up because it's on the schedule.  Others don't like scheduled games at all and prefer open gaming.  There seem to be many different expectations and assumptions for what these games are like.

So, what I'm curious to know is how this community feels about these kinds of games, whether you play in them or not.  If you've never heard of this before, consider- how would you feel about playing a familiar game at a convention knowing that it counted for a tournament and people are probably playing to win?  As mentioned earlier, playing in this game in no way forces you to participate in other tournament games.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who both attends conventions and sometimes runs them, I&amp;#39;m trying to get a better understanding for why some people join games that are part of casual tournaments and why others shy away.&lt;/p&gt;

I recently received Zombicide: Green Horde and paid a total of $150 CAD after taxes and shipping.  When I received it, I was at a point where I really wanted to buy Twilight Imperium and/or Gloomhaven.  Looking at the prospect of a $400 investment for those 2 games, something had to go.  I turned around and sold the unopened Green Horde box for $260.  

I almost doubled my money for literally doing nothing. That kind of return on any investment is pretty staggering.  That being said, the game, like most kickstarters, took about a year to receive, so it was a bit of an investment.  

Now I'm wondering if this is worth doing in bulk.  There's an obvious risk to a game not being delivered, being delayed, or not being as good as expected.  But if you only invested in bigger companies' games like CMON it's a pretty surefire thing. 

I did some research into CMON games specifically and I see that Rising Sun lots have sold for over $400 for only a $100 investment.  Song Song of Ice and Fire The Miniatures Game lots have sold for $600+ for a $200 investment.

And the couple of times I did try, it was very energetic with lots of table talk, making it for a very fun game night.

So, I'm extremely happy to see that they are reprinting it (with some improvements). It's a bit unfortunate that it doesn't have the Discworld theme as I'm a huge fan of Sir Pratchett's work, but the gameplay alone was great for us, so I'm really looking forward to it.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance – oh, and win the game.

In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.

Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:


    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.
    Draw a card from any regular deck – This can be chosen only once by each player.
    Visit the opera and spend $2.
    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.
    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.


Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses – of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! – to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.

At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.

If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.

*Favorite games of your collection*

Mine are:

**Twilight Imperium** - great for 6 more serious games, this is the most epic game Ive played!

**Cosmic Encounter** - screams with replayability, promotes laughter.

**Whitehall Mystery** - when played with 4, this is coop at its finest.  Tense with lots of giggles and snickering.

**878 Vikings** - it's a 2v2 light war game... What more must I say?

Party games:

**Monikers** - tonnes of fun

**Telestrations** - drawings lost in translation... It's a blast

**Secret Hitler** - very deceptive and devious this game is great!


###The Bad
*Least favorite/games shunned to the depths of hell of your collection*

Mine are:

**Dead of Winter** - felt more like a gruelling chore than a game

**Pandemic** - too alphagamer/quarterbacking prone

**Risk 2210AD** - too reliant on the dice roll... After a 7 hour game we never want to play again when other much better games can we played

**Cards Against Humanity** - novelty aside, it's not particularly fun playing prewritten cards to prewritten prompts.  Monikers and Telestrations decimate this game.

**Coup** - this is a game which needs everyone to ""get it""... I dunno it fell flat :(

**Exploding Kittens** - just not very fun.  Sort of avoids any highs or any lows.

###The Ugly
*Unplayed games of your collection*

Mine are:

**Mafia de Cuba** - for next time I have a large group over

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - likewise

**New Angeles** - 6 players is tough... For a whole day and beyond it's TI4, beyond that it's very difficult to decide between staying at 6 or bumping up to party games (especially with Deception and de Cuba to be played).  A longer more complex game, it isn't one to start when people begin leaving either.  I do seriously want to set a day around this game though!  It looks amazing!

**Battle For Rokugan** - when I want to play a game with 5 players that isn't **Cosmic Encounter** or **Mysterium** or even **New Angeles**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twilight Imperium&lt;/strong&gt; - great for 6 more serious games, this is the most epic game Ive played!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/strong&gt; - screams with replayability, promotes laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whitehall Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; - when played with 4, this is coop at its finest.  Tense with lots of giggles and snickering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;878 Vikings&lt;/strong&gt; - it&amp;#39;s a 2v2 light war game... What more must I say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Party games:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monikers&lt;/strong&gt; - tonnes of fun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telestrations&lt;/strong&gt; - drawings lost in translation... It&amp;#39;s a blast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret Hitler&lt;/strong&gt; - very deceptive and devious this game is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Least favorite/games shunned to the depths of hell of your collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead of Winter&lt;/strong&gt; - felt more like a gruelling chore than a game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; - too alphagamer/quarterbacking prone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk 2210AD&lt;/strong&gt; - too reliant on the dice roll... After a 7 hour game we never want to play again when other much better games can we played&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cards Against Humanity&lt;/strong&gt; - novelty aside, it&amp;#39;s not particularly fun playing prewritten cards to prewritten prompts.  Monikers and Telestrations decimate this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coup&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a game which needs everyone to &amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;... I dunno it fell flat :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploding Kittens&lt;/strong&gt; - just not very fun.  Sort of avoids any highs or any lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unplayed games of your collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mafia de Cuba&lt;/strong&gt; - for next time I have a large group over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception: Murder in Hong Kong&lt;/strong&gt; - likewise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Angeles&lt;/strong&gt; - 6 players is tough... For a whole day and beyond it&amp;#39;s TI4, beyond that it&amp;#39;s very difficult to decide between staying at 6 or bumping up to party games (especially with Deception and de Cuba to be played).  A longer more complex game, it isn&amp;#39;t one to start when people begin leaving either.  I do seriously want to set a day around this game though!  It looks amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle For Rokugan&lt;/strong&gt; - when I want to play a game with 5 players that isn&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Mysterium&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;New Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This month we've got a handful of announcements to run through:

# Rule Changes: Intellectual Property

After discussing some challenging rulings lately, we've decided to clarify our stance on intellectual property and reproducibility:

&gt;*Out of respect for designers and publishers in our hobby,* we do not allow any posts that enable a full or significant reproduction/recreation of any game

* Effectively you can share pics of your retheme in play, but not any of the raw images or files you used to make it
* This is not a legality judgment, and will stand even if the images are  public domain or ""fair use"". Legal protections for game concepts and mechanisms are actually notoriously weak or nonexistent, hence one of the reasons the community tries to be self-policing about copying ideas without permission.
* Offering or suggesting to provide files via PM or commenting on such posts asking for files is also clearly not in the spirit of the rule.
* We *may* allow reproducible materials when there's clear approval from the designer/publisher. *However* verifying this approval can be a tedious task for us, so ask first and assume that we're not going to allow it.

&gt;Issues with copyright and other intellectual property violations should be handled through Reddit's [official channels](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/user-agreement#text-content8).

* Assuming the post follows the reproducibility rule, we're not going to try to determine if there are any other IP infringements, i.e. in the case of a retheme using characters or content from a book, movie, TV show, or video game. The mod team is simply unequipped to evaluate legitimacy and reddit already has full procedures and mechanisms for handling such problems.
   * Of couse we still reserve the right to intervene if something seems ""obviously"" wrong or objectively bad for the sub, though these scenarios are likely to trip other rules.

# Rule Changes: Promotional Posts

Continuing from the discussion in our [last town hall](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/95wznh/rboardgames_town_hall_august_2018/), we will be implementing our revisions to promo rules as follows:

&gt;r/boardgames is a community, not an audience. Our rules are designed to promote community engagement, rather than being purely a conduit to promote a blog, podcast, Kickstarter, YouTube channel, or similar. In order to ensure this is maintained, /r/boardgames limits promotional posts or activities for which one could receive a financial benefit to these guidelines:  
&gt;  
&gt;**No more than one post per-user, per-week (7 days) from a single source.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Multiple posts linking the same source require a 10:1 ratio (or greater) of comments between posts.**  
&gt;  
&gt;**Sitewide Reddit karma must be above 100 to share links.**  
&gt;  
&gt;However, sharing content should hopefully not be your primary interaction with /r/boardgames, just as dominating a conversation would not be acceptable in other social engagements. Reddit sitewide guidelines suggest only 10 percent of all your activity should be about your own products. We support similar expectations. r/boardgames is a community, an opportunity for conversation with others who share a similar passion, not an audience.

This is the same basic idea we presented then—to loosen the restrictions on users who are posting from a variety of sources, while compensating with a small karma barrier to limit spam—but slightly revised to handle a few perceived weaknesses. Note that, aside from sub-100-karma accounts, all posts complying with the old rules would still be valid under the new ones.

It may take a little bit for us to get all of our ducks in a row, but we're going to start transitioning to using this guideline immediately.

# Upcoming User Flair Changes and Voting

First of all, **we'll be holding a flair suggestion + voting thread next week,** so get your ideas churning. However things will be a little different this time around:

* **Switching to ""redesign-style"" flairs:** Old reddit implements flair icons with CSS hacks, new reddit supports them as *emoji.* With this flair update we'll be transitioning some-to-most flairs to the new system. This **isn't** a statement that we're throwing our weight behind the redesign in general. The emoji are backwards-compatible, whereas the CSS *isn't* forwards-compatible, so using redesign for this gives us the best overall support. The new system also gives us built-in controls (instead of a 3rd-party script a select few can run) and higher-quality images.
* **Flair count limits:** Our tool previously limited us to 350 flair slots, while new reddit is limited to 300 emojis. However, based on what reddit devs have said publicly, we do expect the limit to be relaxed in the near future. For now, I'm going to cap us at 280 game flairs so that we have a few slots for generic icons and experimentation. For now we'll still use the 350 limit as the threshold for ""bumping off"" old flairs. At the time of the vote thread, I'll post a table of all the least-used flairs that are on or near the chopping block. Note that in the past, we've had vehement fans of low-usage flairs successfully rally and save them from the purge.
* **Resolution upgrade:** Emoji can be uploaded at resolutions up to 128x128px. Even though our flair displays at 16x16 in *CSS pixels*, on many devices with higher *pixel density* you will see a higher-resolution image. For example, my computer sees the revised and old Agricola flairs as below.
   * We do have permission from BGG admins (thanks BGG!) to continue to use their microbadges in our flair system. However their badges are limited to exactly 16x16, so if folks are interested in helping to upgrade, we'll have to coordinate the creation of new images, as well as permission to use the corresponding source material. I'll have more details on this later.

We also have some visual tweaks available on new reddit, like choosing the background color for default flairs (just this week they added a transparent option, too) or upping the flair size. I personally think having larger-than-text-size looks clunky, but on the other hand, it could enable us to use some images that were previously too small to be recognizable.

# Subreddit History Mystery

/r/boardgames **is coming up on its 10th anniversary in a little over a week!** In celebration, we've been exploring our archives and finding some interesting historical posts, #modsarenerds, but there's one glaring omission in our discoveries: *who actually created the subreddit?* Nowadays reddit records the original creator of each sub, but this wasn't true in 2008. Reddit duplicators and generic web history tools don't reach back far enough and only reveal more mysteries. For example, the first post that didn't later get deleted wasn't submitted until 11 months in, but by then there was already a team of several mods?

We're **not** looking for you to message users for us. We've already reached out to a number of folks, and we don't want anyone swarmed with inquiries. It's probably annoying enough when *one* internet stranger asks what you were doing a decade ago! We are looking for either: people who were around in the old days and have any clues or interesting details about the early sub, *or* suggestions of other techniques we can explore.

This isn't high stakes, just looking for some fun trivia as we approach year 11 and several other milestones. *\*cough\** 1 million users *\*cough\** top 100 sub *\*cough\**

&amp;#x200B;

&lt;h1&gt;Upcoming User Flair Changes and Voting&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, &lt;strong&gt;we&amp;#39;ll be holding a flair suggestion + voting thread next week,&lt;/strong&gt; so get your ideas churning. However things will be a little different this time around:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Switching to &amp;quot;redesign-style&amp;quot; flairs:&lt;/strong&gt; Old reddit implements flair icons with CSS hacks, new reddit supports them as &lt;em&gt;emoji.&lt;/em&gt; With this flair update we&amp;#39;ll be transitioning some-to-most flairs to the new system. This &lt;strong&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/strong&gt; a statement that we&amp;#39;re throwing our weight behind the redesign in general. The emoji are backwards-compatible, whereas the CSS &lt;em&gt;isn&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt; forwards-compatible, so using redesign for this gives us the best overall support. The new system also gives us built-in controls (instead of a 3rd-party script a select few can run) and higher-quality images.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Flair count limits:&lt;/strong&gt; Our tool previously limited us to 350 flair slots, while new reddit is limited to 300 emojis. However, based on what reddit devs have said publicly, we do expect the limit to be relaxed in the near future. For now, I&amp;#39;m going to cap us at 280 game flairs so that we have a few slots for generic icons and experimentation. For now we&amp;#39;ll still use the 350 limit as the threshold for &amp;quot;bumping off&amp;quot; old flairs. At the time of the vote thread, I&amp;#39;ll post a table of all the least-used flairs that are on or near the chopping block. Note that in the past, we&amp;#39;ve had vehement fans of low-usage flairs successfully rally and save them from the purge.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Resolution upgrade:&lt;/strong&gt; Emoji can be uploaded at resolutions up to 128x128px. Even though our flair displays at 16x16 in &lt;em&gt;CSS pixels&lt;/em&gt;, on many devices with higher &lt;em&gt;pixel density&lt;/em&gt; you will see a higher-resolution image. For example, my computer sees the revised and old Agricola flairs as below.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do have permission from BGG admins (thanks BGG!) to continue to use their microbadges in our flair system. However their badges are limited to exactly 16x16, so if folks are interested in helping to upgrade, we&amp;#39;ll have to coordinate the creation of new images, as well as permission to use the corresponding source material. I&amp;#39;ll have more details on this later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also have some visual tweaks available on new reddit, like choosing the background color for default flairs (just this week they added a transparent option, too) or upping the flair size. I personally think having larger-than-text-size looks clunky, but on the other hand, it could enable us to use some images that were previously too small to be recognizable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Subreddit History Mystery&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;is coming up on its 10th anniversary in a little over a week!&lt;/strong&gt; In celebration, we&amp;#39;ve been exploring our archives and finding some interesting historical posts, #modsarenerds, but there&amp;#39;s one glaring omission in our discoveries: &lt;em&gt;who actually created the subreddit?&lt;/em&gt; Nowadays reddit records the original creator of each sub, but this wasn&amp;#39;t true in 2008. Reddit duplicators and generic web history tools don&amp;#39;t reach back far enough and only reveal more mysteries. For example, the first post that didn&amp;#39;t later get deleted wasn&amp;#39;t submitted until 11 months in, but by then there was already a team of several mods?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#39;re &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; looking for you to message users for us. We&amp;#39;ve already reached out to a number of folks, and we don&amp;#39;t want anyone swarmed with inquiries. It&amp;#39;s probably annoying enough when &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; internet stranger asks what you were doing a decade ago! We are looking for either: people who were around in the old days and have any clues or interesting details about the early sub, &lt;em&gt;or&lt;/em&gt; suggestions of other techniques we can explore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn&amp;#39;t high stakes, just looking for some fun trivia as we approach year 11 and several other milestones. &lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;cough** 1 million users &lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;cough** top 100 sub &lt;em&gt;\&lt;/em&gt;cough**&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whew; that&amp;#39;s all I&amp;#39;ve got right now. Let us know your thoughts, and again, you&amp;#39;re welcome to discuss any topics here. Game on!&lt;/p&gt;

Hi, everyone. I'm Cole Wehrle. I'm a former academic and now a staff designer and developer at Leder Games in Saint Paul. My brother Drew works at the Chicago Botanic Gardens. Together, we've decided to publish a new edition of Pax Pamir using Kickstarter.

We're here to answer any questions you might have about the new edition of Pax Pamir and it's development. We're also happy to talk about what it's like to work with a close friend and family member, and the experience of trying to start a business in your spare time. I'll be happy to chat about my previous games too, including Root.

And, of course, this is an AMA, so feel free to ask us about anything you'd like. We gab about music and movies and podcasts and books most days anyway, this time it'll just be in public!

I have a solid outline of a plan written up  (with Cole) for how to proceed and I am pleased with how many places we  can impact with expansion.

We DON'T use any of the monster figures, so I'm not concerned with their storage at all, because each of them will be staying in the original box for their game/expansion.

I'm trying to find a single chest with multiple compartments or slots for all the different tiles and chits and tokens and cards.  Preferably something somewhat portable.

I absolutely love the semi-cooperative feel to it, and the remarkably cohesive theme. Specifically:

 * The semi-cooperative portion is multi-faceted. The most common scenario has people all working on the dike for their own benefit, but hoping that it fails, meaning that people ask players with few cards or the wrong resource to help. However, very frequently, a couple people get screwed by the dike early in the game, and begin to work collaboratively to ensure it holds through the end of the game.

 * No one strategy is all-powerful. Often with such light games there's one strategy that will consistently be the best from game to game. This is not the case for Lowlands. The shifting scores, the amount of water coming in, the tiles that come up all affect which strategy is optimal. Sheep will never not be valuable, but they can add up to very few points in a dike-failing game.

 * Lowlands is a long, polynomial equation where the winner is the person with the most points, where every variable is how good of a decision the player made at a certain time, and each coefficient reflects how important that decision was. I very rarely find this type of complexity from a game this short.

 * It's short. Strictly speaking, I prefer a lot of the complexity and mechanics of Great Western Trail or Food Chain Magnate over this game, but this game (and setup) lasting no more than an hour with people who've played before means that it gets to the table more than any other game. You can comfortably play it several times in a night.

 * It's just plain fun. The times people have started yelling when they realize that the dike didn't break, and all of a sudden their hard-earned dike points are worthless, or their sheep aren't going to drown, or they get to throw away their dike tokens are some of my favorite moments in boardgaming. I love GWT, and AFFO, but this game forces you to look up, to engage other players, to pay attention to who's doing what, what the dike looks like, how people are spending their resources, who's going to work on the dike, what resource they're going to invest...not since archipelago have I enjoyed playing WITH others so much, instead of playing in parallel with someone, with their decisions not impacting me greatly.

Have you ever thought about how you can improve the experience for a visually impaired player? Paying attention to a few simple things can go a long way in improving the overall experience for a blind player. 

## Introduction

In the past couple of months, I have been mostly talking about visual accessibility in board games and providing some simple ideas to work around issues blind players may encounter with certain games. In this post, I want to talk about how sighted players can make the whole experience much more pleasant for the visually impaired and make them feel more engaged.

This post will consist of a few things sighted players should know when inviting their visually impaired or blind friends to play. 

## Choosing a Game

Let's start with the basics. When you invite people over, you either inform them of what you will play when organizing the meet up, or you will all decide when everyone arrives and starts pointing at different games on your shelf. Inviting a blind or visually impaired friend, however, requires some more thought as choosing a game that is barely playable and inaccessible may ruin the fun for everyone.

If you are introducing your friend to the hobby, you should narrow down your choices to gateway games. You may be tempted to play something more advanced if everyone else in your group is more experienced, but introducing a visually impaired player to a game like _Istanbul_ or _Power Grid_ may be overwhelming. Technically, this also applies for new sighted players, but the ability to see can speed things up when learning a new game for the first time. 

On the other hand, if the blind player has prior experience, make sure to ask them about the games they've played and enjoyed. You may not own those games, but it will be helpful in narrowing down the choices.

Next, you need to consider one of the biggest visual accessibility problems: hidden information. You probably do not own any Braille conversion kits or do not want to mark your cards with stickers, so if possible try to avoid those games. Cooperative games usually have no hidden information, so that is a good place to start. Games like _Forbidden Island / Forbidden Desert_, _Pandemic_ or _Burgle Bros._ fall into this category. 

There also are competitive games with no hidden information. Some examples are _King of Tokyo / King of New York_, _Camel Up_, or _No Thanks!_. Other good alternatives for intermediate players can be _Dice Forge_ or _Grand Austria Hotel_. This does not mean that games with hidden information are off limits, but they usually require some kind of modifications or visual aids to be playable.

Another thing to be aware of when choosing a game is the size and shape of the components. Blind people can distinguish two different components by touch, so it is important to have different size or shape for different types of resources. As  an example, _Camel Up_ has different sizes for each denomination of the money. One Egyptian Pound is a small cardboard coin, 5 Egyptian Pounds is a slightly larger coin, 10 Egyptian Pounds is a card etc. Now, imagine if all of the denominations were the same and the only way to distinguish them was just by reading the numbers. At the end of the game, when everyone counts their own money to see who the winner is, the blind player would need to sit there and wait for someone else to do it for them.

To summarize, the main goal is to engage the blind player as much as possible, so it is a good idea to spend some thought when choosing a game to play. The less downtime the blind player has, the better the experience for everyone involved should be.

## Setting Up and Tearing Down

Usually, these parts are considered to be the most boring parts in the game. However, if everyone is tasked to do something, it can both be faster and more entertaining than just sitting there and waiting for the host to set up everything.

Blind and visually impaired players are at a disadvantage here as there are some things that they are not able to do or it simply takes longer for them to do. This does not mean that you should completely ignore them during these two stages of the game. A blind player can still shuffle cards, deal cards or other types of resources, count components and store components in plastic bags.

For instance, they may not be able to remove the _Epidemic_ cards from the player card deck in _Pandemic_ for the initial card deal phase, but they can still shuffle the deck if another player removes the _Epidemic_ cards, deal the player cards, make a few stacks, add an _Epidemic_ card to each stack and finally shuffle each stack.

We should also mention the board orientation and positioning here. You can easily overlook this detail, yet it can make a huge difference for a partially sighted player. If the partially sighted player is new to the group, or simply shy by nature, they might not tell you that positioning the board closer to them helps them see the stuff on the board better. Make sure to ask this player how they want the board to be positioned, however, do not forget the sighted players as you don't want to accommodate one player while making gameplay uncomfortable for another.

## Assisting the Blind or Visually Impaired Player

There are games that blind people can play without any assistance, but for most modern board games, a sighted player will need to assist in one way or another. From my personal experience, most of the time it comes down to updating the blind player on the current board state. With the increase in plays of a certain game, and as the player gets more comfortable with the rules, they will require fewer updates from other players to refresh their memory on what is happening on the board. Announcing your own moves is extremely important as well, we discuss this in a little more detail in the next section.

If the game has text on the board or cards that are public knowledge, unless the cards have Braille or some other kind of marks, one sighted player will be required to read the text aloud. Note that, the blind or visually impaired player may not know how to read Braille, so even if you have a Braille kit, they might still require sighted assistance. 

Another area where sighted players can help is arranging cards or other components that are supposed to be hidden from other players in some order the blind player can memorize. This way, they won't require external help during the game. One issue with this is that it will only work for a small number of cards or other components.

An example would be, in _Camel Up_, the race winner and loser bets are supposed to be hidden from other players. What you can do to work around this is, at the start of the game, you can sort the 5 different cards in the order the blind player prefers, e.g. blue, yellow, green, orange, and white. It is easy to memorize a sequence of 5 different colors, so the blind player will not require assistance when they decide to place a final bet face down in the race winner or loser piles.

The best tip I can give you here is to be patient, especially if the blind or visually impaired player is playing a game for the first time. I constantly try to come up with more efficient ways to consume the game state information so that I can minimize the required assistance as much as possible. I should also stress here that blind people are not as helpless as many sighted people perceive. Yes, we need assistance in some areas, but we also adapt to low or no vision and find different ways to consume and memorize more information.

## Announce Your Moves

We briefly mentioned this, but let's explain why this is important. When sighted players play, explaining to the others what you are currently doing is not very common, since they can simply see what is happening on the board. All the blind player will know is that a dice has been rolled or a tile has been placed on the board by hearing a sound. This happens to me in almost all the game nights I have organized, and I kindly need to ask the sighted player what their move was. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that they are doing this deliberately to get an advantage, it is because they are used to consuming information by sight, so they simply forget to announce what they just played.

Announcing your moves lets the blind player keep track of what is going on. It is much easier to know how the board evolves in every step rather than wait until it's the blind player's turn and then give them a full update on the current game state. You should also remind another sighted player to announce their moves if they forget because the blind player may be shy and might stop asking after a couple of times. Bonus points should be awarded to the players that announce when their turn has ended and it is the next player's turn!

## Conclusion

Perhaps some of the things I have mentioned here sound like a no-brainer and obvious to you, but it is astounding how these little accommodations improve the experience both for the visually impaired person and others around  the table. Personally, I have a good time when I see that everyone else is having a good time. If there's sighted person around the table that struggles with a game, perhaps because it is too complex for them, I do not enjoy playing that game, even if it was my favorite game.

I hope some of the points made above will improve your overall experience when you have a blind or visually impaired player around your table. If you were considering inviting a blind friend to play tabletop games with your group, but weren't sure if they would be able to play, try to follow the advice above and you should all have a great time! 

For those of you that already play with blind or visually impaired friends, I would love to hear if you have any other suggestions to improve the quality of a gaming night.

&lt;p&gt;To summarize, the main goal is to engage the blind player as much as possible, so it is a good idea to spend some thought when choosing a game to play. The less downtime the blind player has, the better the experience for everyone involved should be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Setting Up and Tearing Down&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, these parts are considered to be the most boring parts in the game. However, if everyone is tasked to do something, it can both be faster and more entertaining than just sitting there and waiting for the host to set up everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blind and visually impaired players are at a disadvantage here as there are some things that they are not able to do or it simply takes longer for them to do. This does not mean that you should completely ignore them during these two stages of the game. A blind player can still shuffle cards, deal cards or other types of resources, count components and store components in plastic bags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, they may not be able to remove the &lt;em&gt;Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; cards from the player card deck in &lt;em&gt;Pandemic&lt;/em&gt; for the initial card deal phase, but they can still shuffle the deck if another player removes the &lt;em&gt;Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; cards, deal the player cards, make a few stacks, add an &lt;em&gt;Epidemic&lt;/em&gt; card to each stack and finally shuffle each stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We should also mention the board orientation and positioning here. You can easily overlook this detail, yet it can make a huge difference for a partially sighted player. If the partially sighted player is new to the group, or simply shy by nature, they might not tell you that positioning the board closer to them helps them see the stuff on the board better. Make sure to ask this player how they want the board to be positioned, however, do not forget the sighted players as you don&amp;#39;t want to accommodate one player while making gameplay uncomfortable for another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Assisting the Blind or Visually Impaired Player&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are games that blind people can play without any assistance, but for most modern board games, a sighted player will need to assist in one way or another. From my personal experience, most of the time it comes down to updating the blind player on the current board state. With the increase in plays of a certain game, and as the player gets more comfortable with the rules, they will require fewer updates from other players to refresh their memory on what is happening on the board. Announcing your own moves is extremely important as well, we discuss this in a little more detail in the next section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the game has text on the board or cards that are public knowledge, unless the cards have Braille or some other kind of marks, one sighted player will be required to read the text aloud. Note that, the blind or visually impaired player may not know how to read Braille, so even if you have a Braille kit, they might still require sighted assistance. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another area where sighted players can help is arranging cards or other components that are supposed to be hidden from other players in some order the blind player can memorize. This way, they won&amp;#39;t require external help during the game. One issue with this is that it will only work for a small number of cards or other components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An example would be, in &lt;em&gt;Camel Up&lt;/em&gt;, the race winner and loser bets are supposed to be hidden from other players. What you can do to work around this is, at the start of the game, you can sort the 5 different cards in the order the blind player prefers, e.g. blue, yellow, green, orange, and white. It is easy to memorize a sequence of 5 different colors, so the blind player will not require assistance when they decide to place a final bet face down in the race winner or loser piles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best tip I can give you here is to be patient, especially if the blind or visually impaired player is playing a game for the first time. I constantly try to come up with more efficient ways to consume the game state information so that I can minimize the required assistance as much as possible. I should also stress here that blind people are not as helpless as many sighted people perceive. Yes, we need assistance in some areas, but we also adapt to low or no vision and find different ways to consume and memorize more information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Announce Your Moves&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We briefly mentioned this, but let&amp;#39;s explain why this is important. When sighted players play, explaining to the others what you are currently doing is not very common, since they can simply see what is happening on the board. All the blind player will know is that a dice has been rolled or a tile has been placed on the board by hearing a sound. This happens to me in almost all the game nights I have organized, and I kindly need to ask the sighted player what their move was. Don&amp;#39;t get me wrong, I&amp;#39;m not saying that they are doing this deliberately to get an advantage, it is because they are used to consuming information by sight, so they simply forget to announce what they just played.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Announcing your moves lets the blind player keep track of what is going on. It is much easier to know how the board evolves in every step rather than wait until it&amp;#39;s the blind player&amp;#39;s turn and then give them a full update on the current game state. You should also remind another sighted player to announce their moves if they forget because the blind player may be shy and might stop asking after a couple of times. Bonus points should be awarded to the players that announce when their turn has ended and it is the next player&amp;#39;s turn!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Perhaps some of the things I have mentioned here sound like a no-brainer and obvious to you, but it is astounding how these little accommodations improve the experience both for the visually impaired person and others around  the table. Personally, I have a good time when I see that everyone else is having a good time. If there&amp;#39;s sighted person around the table that struggles with a game, perhaps because it is too complex for them, I do not enjoy playing that game, even if it was my favorite game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope some of the points made above will improve your overall experience when you have a blind or visually impaired player around your table. If you were considering inviting a blind friend to play tabletop games with your group, but weren&amp;#39;t sure if they would be able to play, try to follow the advice above and you should all have a great time! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those of you that already play with blind or visually impaired friends, I would love to hear if you have any other suggestions to improve the quality of a gaming night.&lt;/p&gt;

Here's a [link](https://imgur.com/a/t3zv3C2) to a gallery of images from the con. 

**Memoir 44**
Making wargaming easier, Memoir 44 is more than a board-game it's an engine/ruleset for war games. Many have applied the M44 system to other eras/genres. I played the base game several times, both storming and defending Normandy. There's many expansions including Civil War, Air Battles, etc.

**Terraforming Mars**
I played two intense sessions of Terraforming Mars with a great, patient fellow named Dennis. This is a game loosely based on the Red / Green / Blue Mars series of books - wherein Mars is turned into a habitable planet. You play as a corporation utilizing comet-impacts and microbes to transform Mars. The one with the most ""victory points"" at the end of the game wins.

**Century: Spice Road**
A card game where you earn/trade resources to buy cards to earn victory points. Great for 2 players, plus the design was superb. I really enjoyed this game and want to get it for casual gaming with my wife.

**Century: Eastern Wonders**
More resource trading, but this time on a board with ships and ports. Think ""Taipan"" with a colorful board game. Again, the design was wonderful and a ""just 30 min game"" stretched to over an hour as four players jostled to become the supreme trader. There were multiple ways to win, and my strategy worked!

**Here I Stand: Reformation Wars**
I didn't get a good look at this, but it looked something like Axis/Allies but with debates and proselytizing (and some real battles I think.) Every Reformation character was involved, Calvin, Luther, Melanchton and bunches of RC folks. This looked interesting, especially for Reformed folks like myself.

**Miniature War Gaming**
While I wanted to get into some of the miniatures gaming, the rules are often difficult to grasp. So I mostly watched. There's miniature gaming of every kind, typical WWII scenarios, Star Trek and Star Wars, Call of Cthulhu, Tall Ship battles, and everything in between.

**Dungeons and Dragons**
I spent 12 hours playing D&amp;D... I was amazed how organized things have become for large-session gaming like this. I haven't seriously played in 20 years. No longer can you claim to have the Sword of Most Righteous Truth with D20+12 necrotizing damage, you have to prove it! Each session at a Wizards of the Coast sponsored event is numbered and the dungeon master registered. XP (now called AC) and treasure (TC) is called out in the module - so your progress as a player is tracked. 3 good sessions with some interesting folks. Lots of fun, including some Dwarf Tossing was had.

**Splendor**
My wife really enjoyed ""Splendor"" (and bought it after we got home)- a game similar to Century: Spice Road where you earn resources to buy card, but this time it's mining and creating cut jewels during the Renaissance. You try to obtain resources to earn the favor of jewelers to eventually obtain patrons. It was complex and simple at the same time. I didn't do very well. :D

**Massive Darkness**
This appears to be the big contender in dungeon-crawling board games. It comes with 72 figures and randomized dungeon generation. I'm very interested in playing this, and need to find a group to sit in on. This might be the game I've been looking for. Looks pricey but I've wanted something mid-way between D&amp;D and a typical board game.

#**Real life**
Hey! My name is Eric. I'm 27. I've been married for almost 2 years. My son is about to turn 1. I work as a volunteer and community partnership coordinator at a family success center in South New Jersey. I also work part time as a youth &amp; young adults director at a small Christian church. My favorite superhero is St. Walker. My favorite band is Being As An Ocean. And yes, Em just killed it again with Kamikaze.

**How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?**
 
I went to a friend’s house in middle school. His older brother had just bought a new game called Arkham Horror. We wanted to play it. Spent the next 3+ hours playing. I instantly fell in love with the hobby side of gaming that day. After college, I decided to look into current board games and here I am.

#**Gaming habits**

**Do you customize your games? If so, can you describe one of the games you customized?**

I haven’t customized games but I plan on customizing Spirit Island with special presence tokens. I also hope to get some metal coins eventually. 

**How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?**
 
I play anywhere from 1 to 4 times a week. It really depends on who is available/how much free time I have. I mainly play 2-3 player. It is almost always with my wife and/or best friend. If no one is available, I’ll play games alone. I also try to go to a local meetup and I host a monthly meet up where I game with whoever shows up. Judging by BG Stats, the top three places I play are My House, My Meet Up, &amp; My Best Friend’s House.

**Do you have a BGG profile you'd like to share?**

#**Favorites**

**What is your Favorite Game and why?** 

That’s really hard for me to say. I have a top 5 that I all love almost the same. But if I had to pick one game right this second, the first to come to mind is Blood Rage. I am not a huge CMON fan. I am not a big minis fan. But I love all of the mechanics. I love the card drafting. I love the tactics. I love area control. I love action points. I love how combat resolves. I love how you get to create your strategy through the draft. I love being able to customize your clan. I never have a bad time playing this one.

**Favorite gateway game?**

In terms of what people typically call a gateway game, Carcassonne wins. Hands down. Simple. Fun. It’s been talked about forever. I have played this game with many children/youth who are beginning to learn games and this keeps being a success.

In terms of general games that can be a gateway game, Azul wins. I have brought this game out for all sorts of people who have not played hobby board games. It is constantly a hit. My inlaws even bought it after we played. If that is not a successful gateway game, I don’t know what is.

**Who is your Favorite Designer and why?**

It’s hard for me to pick one designer. I don’t really get to play multiple games from the same designer. The first that came to mind is Tim Fowers. His games are always intriguing. All of his designs are unique. They do something fun. They have interesting art. At the very least, I want to play them and see what his mind has come up with.

**Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?** 

Plan B. I enjoy abstracts. I feel like they get how to do abstract games. Their art and table presence is always solid. The game play is fun. Their games are accessible to non hobby gamers &amp; hobby gamers. They are one of the few publishers I look forward to hearing news about. 

**Favorite gaming mechanism?**

That is a toss up between set collection, drafting, &amp; area control.

**Favorite gaming component?**

That is a tie between the peppers in Scoville &amp; the invaders/dihan pieces in Spirit Island. Talk about immersion. 

**What game can you not stand or refuse to play?** 

I will never play Shark Tank. My wife’s whole family loves the tv show. I have spent many hours with her and/or her family watching this show. When I saw it on at the store, I figured it would be an average game. Playable and a good enough time because they love the show. It is literal trash. 

The rules were terrible. The game play, after spending way too much time reading the rule book, was lame. It wasn’t fun. No one liked it. AND THE DIE. The die made me lose my mind. They glued paper on the faces. They were that cheap when they made the game. How do you roll a die with poorly glued on paper? You don’t. How do you tolerate a die so blasphemous to gaming when the rules are incomplete? You don’t. So I threw it in the trash.

#**Q &amp; A**

**Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?**

I do try to give games a numerical rating. I think I should curate my collection to only have great games. Anything that is less than a 7 in my eyes, I don’t need and can be traded away.

I have given 2 games a 10/10; Blood Rage &amp; Spirit Island.

A 10/10 hits everything I am looking for. A strong theme that is complimented with fitting/fun mechanics. Those mechanics add to the theme as well. The game play experience always brings out an emotional response. The art pulls me deeper into the immersion. I find myself wanting to play “just one more game.” I will never turn down a game of it. If there was a fire and I could only grab a small stack, these are the ones I would instantly think of.

**Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?**

I would say I am hybrid gamer. I love all kinds of games. As you can see by explanation of a 10/10, I desire the “best” parts of Euro &amp; Ameritrash; strong game play/mechanics &amp; theme/emotional response. Sometimes that will involve a little luck; sometimes it will involve no luck. Both are fine with me if done correctly.

Those two categories of games can be helpful to give you an idea of what a particular game is generally like. Beyond that, I find it quite worthless. I feel like a lot of games don’t fit neatly into those two categories anymore. We have to grow past that and find a better way to classify games.

**What does /r/boardgames mean to you?**
 
This sub means a lot to me. This is truly a community. I see good conversations happening all of the time. I see great content being shared. I see people coming together due to a shared hobby. And truth be told, life can be hard. Life can feel lonely. Life is chaotic at times. To find a place where anyone is welcome means a lot. I know /r/boardgames has it’s flaws, like any group of humans. But I genuinely believe in the goodness that hobby board games has. This sub reflects that goodness far more than it obscures it.

**What's the much expensive game you've bought or considered buying? How do you determine if a game has been worth it's price?**

I thought about buying Gloomhaven but I knew it would become a life style game. I am constantly debating if I want Forbidden Stars, Mechs vs Minions, &amp; Underground Railroad. 

Primarily, I think about the price of a game similar to paying for an experience. Then it comes down to available capital, time investment, &amp; who can I play this game with.

**What's your favorite type of /r/boardgames content?**

If you couldn’t tell, community means a lot to me. So it may come as no surprise that [COMC] posts seem to be what I look forward to seeing the most. Watching the community share their collection  and share some of their thoughts brings about great discussions. If I find a game on a post and a lot of people don’t talk about it, I want to learn more about it. If I see a game that I own as well, I feel a certain connection as gamers. 

**What are your thoughts on crowdfunding board games? What's your favorite crowdfunded game?** 

I support crowdfunding. I do not support a lot of the bigger companies using that platform. I believe crowdfunding can be a great way to invest in an idea, a person. If we are to be a community, I think this element of the community is big. We trust in each other. Not blind trust but trust none the less. Let the designers earn the right to be trusted. 

It really is a shame bigger companies are using it the way they are. Logical from a profit point of view but really ruins the essence of what crowdfunding is.

My favorite crowdfunded game that I personally backed is Ravage. Easily my favorite dungeon crawler. It is the closest to how I want a dungeon crawl to make me feel &amp; has great mechanics. The art is great too. I am looking forward to the expansions &amp; custom user content down the road.  Seriously, if you like dungeon crawls, find someone with this game and give it a try.

**Do you consider yourself a collector of board games? What do you think about the collection aspect of the hobby?**

I would call myself a collector. To me, collecting is about curating. I don't want everything. I want certain, high quality, meaningful things. I want depth to collection. I want variety. I want quality. I don't think I'll ever want more than 100 games. My soft cap is 75.

**How many games are in your collection? Are you satisfied with that number?**

Assuming BGG is up to date, 43 games are in my collection. Out of those 43, I want 5 out of the collection (Betrayal, Blood of an Englishman, Harbour, Specter Ops, &amp; VivaJava: The Coffee Game: The Dice Game). 

So far, I am pretty satisfied with where I am. There are 15 games I am looking to add to the collection &amp; about 10 I need to look more into.

**If you could only keep 10 games in your collection, what 10 would they be?**  

- Blood Rage  
- Spirit Island
- Adrenaline  
- Roll Player  
- Azul  
- Ravage  
- Village Pillage  
- Dream Home  
- Scoville  
- The Hare &amp; the Tortoise  

&amp;nbsp;

**Is there anything else you'd like to add?** 

Thank you to whoever nominated me! You’re the real MVP. 

Also, go listen to Ding&amp;Dent. Hands down my favorite podcast for board games.

[Past Meeples of the Week](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/meeple_of_the_week)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings board gamers! In an effort to spotlight some standout members of the &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; community, we present to you the Meeple of the Week! Every week we&amp;#39;ll be interviewing Reddit board gamers and presenting their profiles so you can get to know them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s meeple is &lt;a href=""/u/IrateGandhi""&gt;/u/IrateGandhi&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hey! My name is Eric. I&amp;#39;m 27. I&amp;#39;ve been married for almost 2 years. My son is about to turn 1. I work as a volunteer and community partnership coordinator at a family success center in South New Jersey. I also work part time as a youth &amp;amp; young adults director at a small Christian church. My favorite superhero is St. Walker. My favorite band is Being As An Ocean. And yes, Em just killed it again with Kamikaze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went to a friend’s house in middle school. His older brother had just bought a new game called Arkham Horror. We wanted to play it. Spent the next 3+ hours playing. I instantly fell in love with the hobby side of gaming that day. After college, I decided to look into current board games and here I am.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you customize your games? If so, can you describe one of the games you customized?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t customized games but I plan on customizing Spirit Island with special presence tokens. I also hope to get some metal coins eventually. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I play anywhere from 1 to 4 times a week. It really depends on who is available/how much free time I have. I mainly play 2-3 player. It is almost always with my wife and/or best friend. If no one is available, I’ll play games alone. I also try to go to a local meetup and I host a monthly meet up where I game with whoever shows up. Judging by BG Stats, the top three places I play are My House, My Meet Up, &amp;amp; My Best Friend’s House.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a BGG profile you&amp;#39;d like to share?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/user/IrateHope""&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/user/IrateHope&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your Favorite Game and why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s really hard for me to say. I have a top 5 that I all love almost the same. But if I had to pick one game right this second, the first to come to mind is Blood Rage. I am not a huge CMON fan. I am not a big minis fan. But I love all of the mechanics. I love the card drafting. I love the tactics. I love area control. I love action points. I love how combat resolves. I love how you get to create your strategy through the draft. I love being able to customize your clan. I never have a bad time playing this one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gateway game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of what people typically call a gateway game, Carcassonne wins. Hands down. Simple. Fun. It’s been talked about forever. I have played this game with many children/youth who are beginning to learn games and this keeps being a success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In terms of general games that can be a gateway game, Azul wins. I have brought this game out for all sorts of people who have not played hobby board games. It is constantly a hit. My inlaws even bought it after we played. If that is not a successful gateway game, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is your Favorite Designer and why?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard for me to pick one designer. I don’t really get to play multiple games from the same designer. The first that came to mind is Tim Fowers. His games are always intriguing. All of his designs are unique. They do something fun. They have interesting art. At the very least, I want to play them and see what his mind has come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plan B. I enjoy abstracts. I feel like they get how to do abstract games. Their art and table presence is always solid. The game play is fun. Their games are accessible to non hobby gamers &amp;amp; hobby gamers. They are one of the few publishers I look forward to hearing news about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gaming mechanism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a toss up between set collection, drafting, &amp;amp; area control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gaming component?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is a tie between the peppers in Scoville &amp;amp; the invaders/dihan pieces in Spirit Island. Talk about immersion. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What game can you not stand or refuse to play?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will never play Shark Tank. My wife’s whole family loves the tv show. I have spent many hours with her and/or her family watching this show. When I saw it on at the store, I figured it would be an average game. Playable and a good enough time because they love the show. It is literal trash. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

If there was a fire and I could only grab a small stack, these are the ones I would instantly think of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would say I am hybrid gamer. I love all kinds of games. As you can see by explanation of a 10/10, I desire the “best” parts of Euro &amp;amp; Ameritrash; strong game play/mechanics &amp;amp; theme/emotional response. Sometimes that will involve a little luck; sometimes it will involve no luck. Both are fine with me if done correctly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those two categories of games can be helpful to give you an idea of what a particular game is generally like. Beyond that, I find it quite worthless.

&lt;p&gt;I thought about buying Gloomhaven but I knew it would become a life style game. I am constantly debating if I want Forbidden Stars, Mechs vs Minions, &amp;amp; Underground Railroad. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Primarily, I think about the price of a game similar to paying for an experience. Then it comes down to available capital, time investment, &amp;amp; who can I play this game with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Adrenaline&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

I have been playing board games for as long as I can remember.  I still have my copy of **Marvel Super Heroes** from when I was 10 years old.  However, I have only been a collector for just over 3 years now.  Like a lot of people I started expanding my knowledge of the hobby with **Catan**, but I actually found it in a different way.  I hadn't heard of the board game, but instead downloaded the Xbox 360 Arcade version and was hooked.  Shortly after I purchased a physical copy and both my level of immersion and my collection have grown since.

The biggest change I'm going to have to make is buying additional Kallax shelves soon since I have a bunch of Kickstarters delivering and am running out of space.  Unfortunately, that little project is on hold until we move from our Bronx apartment to a house!

My favorite game right now is **Terraforming Mars**.  We recently picked up the **Prelude** expansion and it definitely jump starts things for the better.  My newest game is **Tiny Epic Zombies** which just delivered this Saturday.  We played it this weekend and although the game kicked our butts, we are eager to get it back to the table.

There are still a few games that I haven't got to play yet that are on the shelves.  Most of that is because I don't get to play 3+ player games nearly as much as I do 2 player games since my fiancee is my main gaming partner.  Right now the game I haven't played that I really want to break out is **Feast for Odin** but that is sitting more because I need to get through the rule books.

Hopefully you all enjoy the post.  Thanks for looking!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=""https://imgur.com/a/kTDqnVD""&gt;https://imgur.com/a/kTDqnVD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I really like to play board games but I don't currently have a lot of people to play with, for a number of reasons. My girlfriend of 6 years has never been a big fan of board games. She'll play when we go to board games cafes with friends but it's not usually her favourite activity. More specifically, she doesn't enjoy big strategic games and she gets bored when the rules get too complexed.

Recently, I've mentioned to her that I'd like to try playing a game together so that we can have another activity to share. We looked online and we agreed on Pandemic Legacy has she was attracted by the idea of us playing together instead of against each other. In addition we're both physicians and medicine nerds so that worked out well. I'm pretty excited and she appears to be as well.


However, I'd like to masked the experience for her as pleasant as possible. I want her to enjoy the game so that she gets excited about it.

This game looks deadly in many respects, but my one big concern is lack of significant replayability. The Realm of Knowledge card pool isn't too extensive. Has anyone played on Tabletopia, or any other way, and can comment? It just seems like before long you'd be seeing the same sort of combo appear over and over.

Since the win condition really centers on dealing damage, I'm not sure about the general argument that you can experiment with lots of different play styles. Defensive cards could be handy in the moment, but isn't running one kind of just a stall tactic? Like, eventually you have to ditch that style and just shard up the most efficient damage cards before other ppl do, no?

Maybe a TLDR is that it seems a bit to easily ""solvable""?

This is my third installment of my weekly reddit post called 10 Things You Should Know, eventually to be shortened to 10TYSK. This week we're covering Aeon's End, a deck-building co-operative game by Kevin Riley, published by Action Phase Games and Indie Boards and Games. Each player acts as a mage trying to defeat an extremely powerful nemesis (think Cthulhu types) by casting spells into breaches to deal damage. If the nemesis' HP is drained or his/her deck is depleted before the nemesis destroys the mages or their city, the players win.

1. **If you love deckbuilding, but hate shuffling, this is the deckbuilder for you.** You never have to shuffle your deck, you just flip it over to restart it. This adds another layer of strategy as to how you arrange your discard pile to maximize your deck's efficiency and power.

2. **If you don't like deckbuilding, there isn't enough new game here to satisfy you.** I like to think of this game as a cross between Sentinels of the Multiverse and Big Book of Madness. If those games don't get you excited, this game probably won't either. However, I'm not a *huge* deck-builder guy in general, but this is my favorite one. I have also played Legendary Encounters Aliens, Marvel Legendary, Harry Potter Hogwarts Battle, Clank, Big Book of Madness, and Dominion. So I do have a little experience with the genre.

3. **Set up and take down are the worst parts of the game**, and eventually you may want to house rule the way you do this. Before each game you have to construct the deck for the nemesis, your individual starter decks, and you have to randomly build the market with 3 gems, 4 spells, and 2 relics. If you buy enough expansions, this will give a TON of options for each category. But you'll also eventually find that without certain types of gems, relics, spells, or player powers, winning a game is extremely difficult, if not impossible.

4. As with all co-op deckbuilders, **you may find some games more frustratingly difficult than others**. However, if you play co-op deck-builders, you probably already know this. Sometimes you just get a brutal combination of cards. This game doesn't suffer from Harry Potter-like problems where an opening villain combo means you just have to reshuffle before even attempting to beat them, but it can derail your game. The game does have built in tiers of card difficult like Legendary Aliens and Predator, so that helps.

5. **There are essentially two base games**: Aeon's End (AE) and War Eternal (WE). You can buy either one and have everything you need to play and add expansions to without buying the other. Buying both will give you double sets of only starter cards like sparks and crystal. Everything else will be unique, so if you want more variations in nemeses, nemeses base cards, spells, relics, or gems, go ahead and buy both.

5. **The artwork is nice, the insert is terrible**. If you love great inserts, you will find nothing of the kind in this game. It's cheap cardboard. I have organized my copies into two boxes, one with all the nemeses cards, and one with all the hero cards. The games do come with dividers to enable some quicker set up. What I've done since I have both AE and WE is use a label maker to further organize my cards into alphabetical groupings so I can find spells, relics, and gems even quicker.

6. **Each nemesis is different enough so games feel unique in terms of strategy and play**. They are not all beaten by buying the biggest baddest spells and pounding them into oblivion. With the more difficult level villains, you may find it takes you 2-3 tries to defeat them, and you may find yourself having to try different types of player powers and market cards to defeat them. This is where house ruling comes into play. Personally, I enjoy playing each villain first with purely random market cards (gems, relics, and spells). If we are defeated, we start custom choosing our market cards for the next attempt.

7. **The game never feels so complicated and fiddly that you need a notepad or app to track adjustments**. I mentioned Sentinels of the Multiverse as a comparison. SotM is known for its insane levels of fiddliness. Aeon's End does not have that sort of problem. Anything that needs to be tracked is easily done with tokens that go in their required place, and is not complicated. You may find, at most, that you just need to do a minor adjustment or two to your spells' damage levels which can easily be monitored.

8. **Each game takes roughly an hour**. And that's definitely a plus for this type of game. You can easily get in 1-3 sessions in a night. I enjoy this more than say Year 7 of Harry Potter where I have to go through all 7 years of villains in order to beat the final year.

9. **Replayability is not super high**. I don't see myself playing nemeses again and again. Perhaps, after I beat them all, I may try to beat the more fun ones on their advanced difficulty setting, but I'm not even sure about that. This game is fun, but it doesn't get my blood boiling for more plays. I bought this wanting to try a new type of deckbuilder, and bought expansions because there is a guy in my group who LOVES it. There are lots of small ways to tweak a nemesis more to your preference. If you want an easier game or a harder game, you can also adjust HP of the nemesis or city or even heroes.

10. **There is a legacy version coming out later this year.** If you are interested in the game, but want something even more unique, you might consider waiting for that. If you decide to buy AE or WE now, they are compatible with the legacy game. The legacy game is semi-resettable) you need a pack. 

I hope this helps if you're considering buying this. Next week we'll discuss Twilight Struggle!

Recently my wife and I have been looking for ways to trim down the collection as well as procure some fodder for upcoming Math Trades. We have gone through many different methods in order to remove some of the games in our collection, but have come to enjoy one in particular.

This method I'll call the 5 In A Row Challenge. I originally read about it from someone else on this sub who mentioned it as a way to remove games from their collection (credit goes to them entirely, this is just a reporting of our experience). We were skeptical at first, but then we decided to try it.

The 5 In A Row Challenge is simply a gauntlet of 5 plays of the same game in a row (over multiple play sessions). For example, we played 7 Wonders: Duel as the first candidate for the challenge. We played it 3 times the first day and 2 more times another day. The only stipulation is that you can't play anything other than the selected game until you're finished with the 5 plays.

The game fails the challenge if at any time while you're playing the game you think to yourself ""I don't want to play this again..."" Oppositely the game passes if it makes it through the 5 play gauntlet if you never think the above statement.

This all stems from my (perhaps unpopular) opinion that there is no point in owning games that you wouldn't want to play all the time.

So what does this do? The 5 In A Row Challenge allows me to quickly see which games should really belong in my collection. Obviously YMMV depending on your circumstances, but it works very well for us (we can't all play TI4 whenever we want to, or even 5 times in a row for that matter).

It also allows you to delve more deeply into the strategy involved with the game you're currently playing. Example: My wife and I put Abyss on the list just yesterday and actually had the time to crank out 5 games in about 2 hours. After the third game, I began to see common aspects in the winning strategies that were used across the games. We'd played the game 9 times before this already, but this was new to me. It was a cool experience to see an overarching strategy emerge from our multiple play sessions. As a result, we both became better players of the game. This probably would not have happened if we had played Abyss over the course of a few months interspersed with other games. The raw exposure allowed us to learn new tactics and strategies.

I just thought I'd throw this out there. Has anyone else tried anything similar to this and achieved similar results?

EDIT 1: It has been brought to my attention (and I agree) that this largely only applies to games that are on the lighter side. 

EDIT 2/Rant: I haven't changed the original text because I guess I've learned that I'm just more tolerant relative to everyone else. I don't get burned out playing a game multiple times. Every game in my collection has seen more than 5 plays because it deserves that many (or more). I have no shelf of shame because it's a waste. You could grab any game in my collection and (given that we had the time and player count to play it) I would play it, no hesitation. But all in all, to each his own. It's part of being in a hobby, you get to define how you enjoy it :)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey all!&lt;/p&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In many ways 7 Wonders Duel resembles its parent game 7 Wonders as over three ages players acquire cards that provide resources or advance their military or scientific development in order to develop a civilization and complete wonders.

What's different about 7 Wonders Duel is that, as the title suggests, the game is solely for two players, with the players not drafting cards simultaneously from hands of cards, but from a display of face-down and face-up cards arranged at the start of a round. A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.

Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.

Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.

A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.

This GoTW repost gives people of the sub a chance to discuss the game again after a bit of time has passed. Do you still play it? If so, how often does it make it to the table? Has the game held up after repeated plays? Has it moved up or down in your personal ranking? Has it been replaced by a newer, similar game? Has it replaced a game?

My current one is “to provide students of (my school) with a fun environment to play board games and meet new friends.” I have a decent sized &lt;a href=""https://i.imgur.com/e4GMnpk.jpg""&gt;collection &lt;/a&gt; so I’m not worried about acquiring the games as much as teaching so many new people so many new games. Advice?

While I love Blood Rage, I think the game gets hurt in the variety department by containing some very underpowered cards that rarely ever get drafted in its limited card pool.

Since board games can't benefit from timely updates for balance changes like online games, I've come up with a few ideas on how to change them so they're still low tier but fullfil their respective niches better. I'm also trying to change the Dwarf Chieftain and the Soldier of Hel into more interesting cards, as they provide no combos and are just free stat sticks. Besides those 2, it seems the general consensus for the worst offenders in the game are:

​

# AGE 1

* **Thor's Glory**  (Cost 2 **-** Gain 2 glory whenever at least 2 enemy figures are destroyed in a battle you participate in.)  
This card is awful because it costs at least 33% of your rage in Age 1 (likely more since some will be siphoned out by Loki), takes up a clan upgrade slot and provides a rather marginal (and very conditional!) benefit. It needs to trigger 3 times to beat out an Age 1 quest, while costing rage to play (on the Age you'll likely need it most), being arguably harder to trigger and not advancing a clan stat.  
*My suggestion: Making the upgrade* ***cost only 1 rage and upping the reward to 3 glory***. *It should give some legs to the card into the late game and tie in nicely with Valkirie, which is another card that can afford a little help through sinergy.*  

* **Tyr's Domain**  (Cost 0 **-**  After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +3 battle card.)  
To play this you'll lose a turn in Age 1, have to draft more quests instead of potentially more useful cards and if you win the battle you played the quest in you'll end up losing your quest card, not to mention this takes up a clan upgrade slot. All of that for turning quests into mediocre battle cards.  
*My suggestion:* **Make it cost 2, but give it a rather powerful extra effect - you get to keep the quest card used as a +3 battle card even if you win the battle.** *This makes it so you take a significant hit in rage at age 1 in exchange for a lot of future flexibility regarding your draft in the next 2 ages. It is also still susceptible to being countered by the card canceling battle cards in Age 2 and 3, and forces you to reveal at least one quest in your hand. Credits to* /u/MicromegaX.  

* **Dwarf Chieftain**  (Cost 2\* **-**  \*Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)The Chieftain is a very decent monster, but it's also quite bland. In a game that's all about combos, it has pretty much 0 sinergy with anything else. Having a retail copy of the game, I'd like to fill up the spot left vacant by the Mountain Giant, as he increases the value in the ""lord"" line of cards, which are generally mid-to-low tier.  
*My suggestion: Rather than straight up proxying the Mountain Giant, I'd like this little dude to* ***cost 2 rage, have 2 STR and count as a leader***. *This is thematic - Dwarf CHIEFTAIN counts as a weaker leader and also has a nice parallel with how the Hydra is a stronger boat in Age 1. The reduction in cost is offset by the weaker STR for the rest of the game and better enables use of the overcosted Lord of Hammers without having to mess with that card as well.*  

* **Lord of Hammers  (Cost 3** \- If you successfully pillage with your leader, you may move him to an adjacent province.)  
While this might net a nice tempo gain, the cost in the first Age is ridiculous for the effect.  
*My suggestion:* **lowering the cost down to 2** *along with having a second leader in the game should help this see some fringe play.*  
 

# 

# AGE 2

There's nothing really egregious about Age 2, I feel it is the best balanced in the game.

​

&amp;#x200B;

# AGE 3

* **Völur Witch**  (Cost 3 - May retreat from an outer province to Yggdrasil instead of being destroyed.)  
Simply costs too much for what it does, even though what it does can certainly be useful for draining opponent's battle cards.  
*My suggestion: I'd like to take a page out of the scrapped design for the Mystic Troll and make this* ***cost 2 rage, have 2 STR, but provide 1 bonus STR for up to 4 of your warriors in the same province***. *This means that accompanied by no warriors it's strictly worse than the already middling monster Soldier of Hel (since the Witch would cost 1 rage), but it also has a higher ceiling, particularly for Yggdrasil battles, where it can potentially provide 6 strength. This is also rather thematic, as the Volur Witch can be thought of as giving bloodlust to your warriors.*  

* **Tyr's Wrath (Cost 1** \- After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +5 battle card.)  
This manages to be even worse than it's first age cousin, if only because there are so many better options in the third age and the action economy is even more valuable because this age tends to end quickly. Also worth noting that third age quests are worth tons of points, so if this is going to see play it needs to provide a more powerful effect.  
*My suggestion: Make it* ***cost 0 rage, make the quest count as a +3 battle card that can be used after battle cards are revealed****. Still not sure this would be enough to make it see play.*  

* **Soldier of Hel** (Cost 3\* - \*Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)  
Like the Dwarf Chieftain, this dude is OK (actually worse than his Dwarven friend as he offers only a +1 STR a full 2 ages later), but he's rather bland and offers no sinergy.  
*My suggestion: Let's make this dude what the Volur Witch should have been from the start:* ***2 STR, costs no rage to invade and retreats to Yggdrasil rather than being destroyed***. *With no cost and 2 STR he'll be better suited for losing battles and draining your opponent's battle cards. Quite thematic that this zombie-like figure refuses to stay dead and springs forth from Yggdrasil time and time again.*

I would like some experienced BR players to chime in on what I'm doing with these cards balance wise. Did I go too far, did I not push hard enough. Please let me know!

&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: Rather than straight up proxying the Mountain Giant, I&amp;#39;d like this little dude to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cost 2 rage, have 2 STR and count as a leader&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;This is thematic - Dwarf CHIEFTAIN counts as a weaker leader and also has a nice parallel with how the Hydra is a stronger boat in Age 1. The reduction in cost is offset by the weaker STR for the rest of the game and better enables use of the overcosted Lord of Hammers without having to mess with that card as well.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lord of Hammers  (Cost 3&lt;/strong&gt; - If you successfully pillage with your leader, you may move him to an adjacent province.)&lt;br/&gt;
While this might net a nice tempo gain, the cost in the first Age is ridiculous for the effect.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;lowering the cost down to 2&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;along with having a second leader in the game should help this see some fringe play.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;AGE 2&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s nothing really egregious about Age 2, I feel it is the best balanced in the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;AGE 3&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Völur Witch&lt;/strong&gt;  (Cost 3 - May retreat from an outer province to Yggdrasil instead of being destroyed.)&lt;br/&gt;
Simply costs too much for what it does, even though what it does can certainly be useful for draining opponent&amp;#39;s battle cards.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: I&amp;#39;d like to take a page out of the scrapped design for the Mystic Troll and make this&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cost 2 rage, have 2 STR, but provide 1 bonus STR for up to 4 of your warriors in the same province&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;This means that accompanied by no warriors it&amp;#39;s strictly worse than the already middling monster Soldier of Hel (since the Witch would cost 1 rage), but it also has a higher ceiling, particularly for Yggdrasil battles, where it can potentially provide 6 strength. This is also rather thematic, as the Volur Witch can be thought of as giving bloodlust to your warriors.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tyr&amp;#39;s Wrath (Cost 1&lt;/strong&gt; - After you reveal a quest card in combat, you may treat it as a +5 battle card.)&lt;br/&gt;
This manages to be even worse than it&amp;#39;s first age cousin, if only because there are so many better options in the third age and the action economy is even more valuable because this age tends to end quickly. Also worth noting that third age quests are worth tons of points, so if this is going to see play it needs to provide a more powerful effect.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: Make it&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;cost 0 rage, make the quest count as a +3 battle card that can be used after battle cards are revealed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;. Still not sure this would be enough to make it see play.&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Soldier of Hel&lt;/strong&gt; (Cost 3* - *Costs no rage to upgrade or invade.)&lt;br/&gt;
Like the Dwarf Chieftain, this dude is OK (actually worse than his Dwarven friend as he offers only a +1 STR a full 2 ages later), but he&amp;#39;s rather bland and offers no sinergy.&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;My suggestion: Let&amp;#39;s make this dude what the Volur Witch should have been from the start:&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;2 STR, costs no rage to invade and retreats to Yggdrasil rather than being destroyed&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;em&gt;With no cost and 2 STR he&amp;#39;ll be better suited for losing battles and draining your opponent&amp;#39;s battle cards. Quite thematic that this zombie-like figure refuses to stay dead and springs forth from Yggdrasil time and time again.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like some experienced BR players to chime in on what I&amp;#39;m doing with these cards balance wise. Did I go too far, did I not push hard enough. Please let me know!  &lt;/p&gt;

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

I need help identifying a game that I played over a year ago. All I recall about it was that it was a card based game ( I don’t think there was a board at all.) It came in a smaller box about the size of sushi go or similar card games.  It had really beautiful Asian (Japanese?) art-elaborately designed female characters in kimono. I remember starting with a new character card at the beginning of each round. 

It may have been a game from gen con 2017 as it was right after the con and the guys I played with had just got a ton of games there. It was a public game night so I can’t find them to ask them. 

I would appreciate any suggestions you may have. I’ve scoured tons of sites and it’s none of the largely popular titles that I can find. Thanks in advance!

I’ve been in the hobby for about 4 years now, and the first games I bought were Ticket to Ride and Carcassonne after playing them at a friend’s house. I was immediately hooked after seeing the depth of gaming that I was missing out on having only been raised on games like Monopoly and Sorry. 

One thing I plan on changing is building a built in shelf system for this wall specifically for the growing collection. That and I’ll probably pare down the collection more in the future as new games replace ones that don’t hit the table anymore. 

Our current favorites are Everdell and Raiders of the North Sea. 

I can get pretty obsessed with organization, so a large number of these have third party game inserts, with Lords of Waterdeep and Scythe being the most upgraded of the collection. 

Anyway, just wanted to share with the community - thanks for being awesome!

So I wanted to know what the etiquette is regarding feeling physically drained and not wanting to continue playing. Should I simply end the game by helping another player win or should I simply explain how I feel and bow out?

** Feel free to just simply answer without the following context. **

About a month ago, I was at a local all-day board gaming event called GenCan't. The second game I got into was Lords Of Hellas. I had heard people talking about it before. Couldn't remember the context. But I wanted to play to get that experience. I think it was a good half an hour to forty five minute explanation of the rules, which didn't really help to explain anything. 

You know when you understand the words that the person said, but you're still lost in the process of gameplay? Anyways, cut to three hours later, and I don't feel good. I hate long games and I especially hate long games with long turn delays. (It was more than ten minutes between each turn at this point.) 

I am feeling like I physically just do not want to be here. I don't care that I'm not winning. I don't really even care that I could maybe win. I try to just for the sake of good gamesmanship, but that gets shut down pretty easily. I think three of our four monuments were completed to about half. I'm not in territory for any of them. I'm to the left of Sparta and the nearest monument is in the neighboring territory. Two guys seem to be winning with the owner of the game being in the lead. Neither of them can clinch it. I'm stuck with little to no chance and the person that has the nearest monument to me doesn't seem to be on-point with their strategy. 

I realize that I can probably shut the game down by ending the whole turn order and building the monument to 3/4s in that guy's territory. Then when it gets back around to my turn, doing it again to complete it off.

I agonize for the next fifteen minutes on which is better etiquette: to walk away or just complete the monument. I'm getting more and more drained so I just figured I'll complete the monument and make a half-assed effort to try and be in the territory to maybe possibly win.

45 minutes later, before I can do that, the owner of the game wins by slaying his &lt;x&gt;th monster and I'm done. Completely solidified how I absolutely despise long turn delays.

What do you value more quality or price?

I am currently developing a game called Curators that I intend to release on Kickstarter in April. The game is a medium light tile building euro with a new action selection mechanism involving poker like chips.

The problem I am facing is what material I should go for with the chips. For quality I think the best shot would be real poker chips but that would make the game immensely expensive. So there for I am currently thinking plastic or card board. What would you prefer a game that costs $65 with real poker chips or something with cardboard or plastic that cost $40. 

Thanks for your opinions.

If any one is interested in having a look at the game in the early stages it looks like this at the moment. Just so you know what we are talking about.

Some random thoughts I had were for Scar and Madam Mim. 

For Madam Mim I’m thinking her goal should be to defeat Merlin in a wizard’s duel by defeating all his animal forms. But Madam Mim wouldn’t have allies, instead she’d have a new card type called “form” or something like that. She could only have one form on the board at a time and the form would follow her when she moved locations, giving some benefit, maybe each form would give a different action. But forms would be used to defeat specific forms of Merlin. Like Cat form would defeat Mouse Merlin, or Rhino form would defeat Turtle Merlin. I think Purple Dragon form might be able to defeat any Merlin Form. 

Then you discard your form to defeat a specific Merlin and the Merlins are removed from the game and once you defeat all his forms, maybe 4-5, you win. 

Mim could also have an effect card called “Disappear” which could work the same way as Maleficent’s “Vanish” or maybe some different way. And she’d need ways to get into the fate deck and look for heroes. 

For Scar his goal could be to defeat adult Simba at Pride Rock. The thing would be that Simba is a double sided card. He starts on Young Simba side who cannot be defeated, but moves location one to the right each turn as Simba makes his way around the board from Pride Rock to the Watering Hole to the Elephant Graveyard. When Mufasa is  defeated, it flips Simba over and he becomes Adult Simba who acts like a regular hero and immediately moves Adult Simba to the spot furthest from Pride Rock.

The 6 individual bins I'm going to try to make just a bit more pale than the player pieces (probably just thin the paint out so the grain shows) so the pieces stand out better.  And as of now, not planning on doing the main divider.

I've also got a pair of [these](https://www.thebrokentoken.com/tabletop-card-holder-3-tray-mini/) for BSG, going to paint them to match the respective skill cards, then give them a black wash.  But again, no idea what to do for the outside.

Yesterday, I picked up Venus Next and Prelude (I've had Hellas &amp; Elysium for a while), and shuffled them into the decks. I also took the time to shuffle in the Corporate Era cards, as we've not yet used them (about 80% of our games of TM have at least one new player).

So we went from base cards w/o drafting to using Base + Corporate Era + Venus Next + Prelude (including the Prelude cards) + Drafting.

Our engines weren't just going... They roared to life early and we were playing 25+ MC cards by generation 3. I was a bit worries about all the mechanics getting diluted with all the extra cards, but I think the game was at its absolute best with everything going at once.

## What this is:

 This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

 All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

 Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

I hope that Thibaud, will release more expansions and continues developing the game.

Otherwise, I think that we should all get together and come after Thibaud. We are going to capture him and make him develop more content for this awesome game.

Why is it always ten anyhow? Just because we've got 10 digits? It's an arbitrary number I say, so my list is just as valid!

So, here are 9 amazing games, all of which are definite desert island material. These are my most beloved games and they all offer huge amounts of depth and variablity while not leaving the fun behind.

**9. Pax Pamir**

The simplest of the Pax games. This one doesn't look like much, and it comes in a tiny box. The initial looks of it will turn many gamers off, but man is it a doozy. It's probably the tightest design out of all the Pax games, cutting away most of what is nonessential (and even more has ended up on the cutting block for the second edition!)

This is a streamlined Pax experience that reaches its culmination with the addition of the Khyber Knives expansion, which completes the game and is a must have.

Why is this at the bottom of the list? I like my chrome and rough edges in games, and the other Pax games definitely have more of those. Still, this is one of the coolest gaming experiences you can have with intrigue, spies, wars, trade, and politics in a fascinating foreign landscape.

**8. The Artifact**

This is an unknown gem that is actually still in print! You can order it from Print and Play games right now in fact, though beware, the price is a bit high because it is made in the US and spots some excellent production values.

What is The Artifact about? It's a four way blind role-playing board game with hidden identities that requires a Game Master to keep track of things. There are goals and strict rules and it plays in an evening.

Four different factions find themselves on a space station, each trying to achieve its own set of goals. Who will come out on top? The Pirates who are trying to gain The Artifact (roll credits!)? The Mad Scientist who is trying to get paid? The telephone company employees who might or might not be government spies? Or will it be the mysterious alien who might or might not be a shapeshifter, a swarm hive mind of man-eating xenomorphs or maybe even the sentient computer in control of the whole station? Or maybe the factions will negotiate to team up and go for a shared victory. Everything is possible!

Fight through crowded corridors and fog of war or take the less traveled path and blow a hole into the side of the space station, put on your space suit and enter from that way. But wait, did the commander just turn traitor? Was he a government spy all along?

This game offers so many hilarious situations and plays differently every time. It really shouldn't work but somehow manages to do so anyhow.

**7. Pax Renaissance**

The very best of the Pax games. Pax Renaissance is complicated, obtuse, terrible to learn and teach and doesn't hold your hand. It drops you into renaissance Europe with naught but a few coins in hand and you have to make your way into controlling kings, empires, republics, bishops, knights, nobility.

Cut a deal with Vlad the Impaler to behead your enemies. Lead the Ottoman Empire into war. Become the Pope - or become the Antipope and lead the reformation to victory. Initiate the Renaissance through free elections in many states (the outcome of which you control of course) or win through conquests as you take over Europe. Go off and win through trade in a Globalization victory or just be the one who was the greatest patron of art and science at the end of the game while plotting to disrupt your enemies throughout the game.

And this is just a sliver of what's possible in this 90 minute game. Yes, it does indeed play in that short amount of time. Oh what stories this game tells.

**6. Pax Porfiriana**

So if Pax Renaissance is the best Pax game, why is this here? 

Because it is rough, it is crazy, and it is bold. You play with less than half of the cards the game comes with every game, yet somehow it always congeals into a cohesive whole without throwing all the balance out of whack.

The artwork is... strange, the cards are hard to wrap your head around, their layout is alien. It is as if this game came from another dimension where design principles took a very... different part in their evolution.

But once it clicks, this game becomes a masterpiece. 

You are a Mexican landowner trying to become the next leader of the country by toppling the nefarious leader Porfirio Diaz. You do so by acquiring land and soldiers to do your bidding, by assassinating your opposition, by controlling events in your favor and changing the political climate. Maybe you will lead the country into a bright economic future or trigger a great depression, it is all up for grabs.

But what if you've been beaten down? What if you've been unjustly attacked by other players' armies? What if your land has been taken, your allies assassinated and you're left with the dregs? You'd be outraged, wouldn't you?

And thus, you start courting this outrage, making your plight public. You collect outrage points, start assassinating your own cards as strawmen to show the public how dire the need is to topple this unfair dictatorship.

Unlike any other take that game, being take thatted in this one just opens up another path towards victory for you. Nobody's ever out of the game in this brilliant and chaotic ride.

**5. High Frontier**

The Space Game. 

This is the one. Kerbal Space program distilled down to its nuts and bolts. High Frontier lets you colonize and industrialize space on an absolutely breathtaking map of the solar system that isn't to scale, but instead based on potential energy. This game is a labor of love 30 years in the making and it shows. Not only are its systems accurate to real life specs and amazingly easy to get the hang of once you get over the initial hurdle, it is also a tightly designed competitive game that holds up to many repeat plays.

And here's the secret: Everyone makes this out to be a dry, serious, scientific, educational rocket game. And that's part of it, sure. But what they don't tell you: The end game turns into crazy speculative sci-fi. Things that can happen are:

- Terraforming Venus by throwing a giant rock at it
- Leaving the solar system in a massive generation starship
- Becoming the supreme cult leader 
- Destroying Earth by throwing an asteroid at it
- The Emancipation of all robots
- The creating of great amounts of anti matter
- Leading a revolution on Earth
- Creating a black hole

And many more. 

It's a long game, but worth every second of it.

**4. Sidereal Confluence**

What a title, huh? I wouldn't pay it too much mind. They probably just realized Cosmic Encounter was taken. And it does look like Cosmic Encounter at first, what with the asymmetric constellation of different alien factions that players can take control of. But it turns out to be a very different beast.

While both games have negotiation at their core, there are a lot of important differences to note. In Cosmic Encounter, you negotiate alliances during attacks, the space for negotiation is limited and mostly amounts to whom to gang up on. In Sidereal Confluence meanwhile, negotiation is constant and at the heart of the game. It's all about trade, and everything goes. Future deals are binding! What other game lets you do that?

I've never had as much fun wheeling and dealing as in this game. There is zero luck, but different player constellations mean that no game will ever play out the same, even with the same factions in play.

Surprisingly, all interaction in this game is positive. Very rarely do you deliberately deny someone a trade just to hurt them, as they are a valuable trade partner and you're always trying to curry favor. In fact, you actively try to help your opponents make better deals, since when they are better off, you will have more resources available through trading with them in turn, creating a positive feedback loop that feeds into itself like crazy.

I've heard it said that if a good player plays this game, he raises everyone's end game score by about 10 points, not just his own, and it shows. I've never seen a competitive game that fosters such warm feelings towards each other amongst its players.

**3. Root**

It's new, I know, but it's here to stay. I've been playing prototype versions of this game since the beginning of the year, I've played it more than pretty much any other game and I still want to play it all the time.

Unlike the other games in this list, I don't think much more needs to be said about this one. It's a well known game and the hype train is going strong right now, so I'm sure everybody already knows all about it.

Cute game about animals being excellent to each other!

**2. Spirit Island**

The best coop game in existence. Yes, better than Gloomhaven. It unjustly got dealt some bad reviews by The Dice Tower and Shut Up and Sit Down. This game is so massively replayable it's uncanny. So many different spirits, scenarios, and adversaries, it offers endless amounts of combinations to vary up the game. It's as if you could play Pandemic and decide to fight crime instead of viruses. Or maybe the whales. Whatever takes your fancy.

Fight the whales!

Ahem...

Spirit Island is a game about island spirits (huh, whoda thunk) defending their island from colonizers. You draft cards and use them in various ways to get rid of the menace invading your island, all while coordinating with your spirit mates and lamenting the blight that is slowly taking over what used to be a wonderful natural paradise.

This games often seems hopeless, you'll have to concede some land to the invaders, the white plastic starts spreading, the level 2 invader cards come out, you have to turn over the island card to the blighted side, all seems lost, they're everywhere!

Then suddenly you realize you've gained enough power to remain almost blightless for a turn. Oh, and the next. Oh, and you're getting fear cards left and right, helping out even more, driving the accursed invaders off your land. Level 3 invaders? Let them come, you're ready! AAAHAHAH!

DIE MOTHERTRUCKERS! DIE! MUAHAHAHAHAHA

Note: Get the Branch &amp; Claw expansion. It doubles the power decks and most crucially adds the event deck, which is neccessary for this not to devolve into a dry puzzle game by adding some much needed uncertainty.

**1. Argent: The Consortium**

I don't like worker placement games. But I like this one. I've never seen anything like it. 

The chancellor of the magical university has decided to step down and the players are now trying to take his place. Equipped with a variety of underling mage workers with different magical powers and a starting spell, they get to it.

Unlike other worker placement games, this one is extremely interactive. Push other people's mages off the board (not to worry, they will get compensated for it... most of the time), push for tempo and end the round before other people can pull off all their plans, research spells, destroy rooms full of your opponents or just travel to a different plane where you can do everything you want without being caught up in all the mayhem that all the other players are causing.

Who wins at the end? Well, that depends on the consortium voters in charge of electing the next chancellor. The catch? Their identities are secret. Slowly during the game you can use some actions to discover what the victory conditions of each respective game actually are. The end scoring in this game usually can't be calculated in advance, as nobody has access to the whole picture (unless they invested a ton of resources into gaining this knowledge). Revealing the voters and counting up the votes in the game's great reveal is the most exciting that end game scoring has ever been. A nail biter until the end.

Of course, after a game of this, you'll want to play again right away. But hey, what's this? All the worker placement tiles have a back side? And hey, you've used less than half of the ones in the box in that game (Since you own the expansion. You do own the expansion, right?). So the next game is completely different! Different board layout, different voters, different spells, different magical items, different end of round bonuses, different supporters. Different... wait, the mage powers have a different backside? So not even your workers will be the same! And that's without even counting the scenarios that come in the expansion. And hey, maybe the Archmage will come for a visit and leave their staff up for grabs for yet more possibilities.

It's like the castle of Hogwarts, shifting around, never the same. If you enjoy discovery in your games, this one has an incredible amount of variety to it. You'll never have to play the same game of Argent twice (but you'll want to and you can).","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to make a top 10 games list, but I could only come up with 9 games that truly warranted being on it, so in the end it just had to be a top 9 list. Why is it always ten anyhow? Just because we&amp;#39;ve got 10 digits? It&amp;#39;s an arbitrary number I say, so my list is just as valid!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, here are 9 amazing games, all of which are definite desert island material. These are my most beloved games and they all offer huge amounts of depth and variablity while not leaving the fun behind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9. Pax Pamir&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why is this at the bottom of the list? I like my chrome and rough edges in games, and the other Pax games definitely have more of those. Still, this is one of the coolest gaming experiences you can have with intrigue, spies, wars, trade, and politics in a fascinating foreign landscape.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8. The Artifact&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an unknown gem that is actually still in print! You can order it from Print and Play games right now in fact, though beware, the price is a bit high because it is made in the US and spots some excellent production values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What is The Artifact about? It&amp;#39;s a four way blind role-playing board game with hidden identities that requires a Game Master to keep track of things. There are goals and strict rules and it plays in an evening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Four different factions find themselves on a space station, each trying to achieve its own set of goals. Who will come out on top? The Pirates who are trying to gain The Artifact (roll credits!)? The Mad Scientist who is trying to get paid? The telephone company employees who might or might not be government spies? Or will it be the mysterious alien who might or might not be a shapeshifter, a swarm hive mind of man-eating xenomorphs or maybe even the sentient computer in control of the whole station? Or maybe the factions will negotiate to team up and go for a shared victory. Everything is possible!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fight through crowded corridors and fog of war or take the less traveled path and blow a hole into the side of the space station, put on your space suit and enter from that way. But wait, did the commander just turn traitor? Was he a government spy all along?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This game offers so many hilarious situations and plays differently every time. It really shouldn&amp;#39;t work but somehow manages to do so anyhow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7. Pax Renaissance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The very best of the Pax games. Pax Renaissance is complicated, obtuse, terrible to learn and teach and doesn&amp;#39;t hold your hand. It drops you into renaissance Europe with naught but a few coins in hand and you have to make your way into controlling kings, empires, republics, bishops, knights, nobility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cut a deal with Vlad the Impaler to behead your enemies. Lead the Ottoman Empire into war. Become the Pope - or become the Antipope and lead the reformation to victory. Initiate the Renaissance through free elections in many states (the outcome of which you control of course) or win through conquests as you take over Europe. Go off and win through trade in a Globalization victory or just be the one who was the greatest patron of art and science at the end of the game while plotting to disrupt your enemies throughout the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And this is just a sliver of what&amp;#39;s possible in this 90 minute game. Yes, it does indeed play in that short amount of time. Oh what stories this game tells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;6. Pax Porfiriana&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if Pax Renaissance is the best Pax game, why is this here? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because it is rough, it is crazy, and it is bold. You play with less than half of the cards the game comes with every game, yet somehow it always congeals into a cohesive whole without throwing all the balance out of whack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The artwork is... strange, the cards are hard to wrap your head around, their layout is alien. It is as if this game came from another dimension where design principles took a very... different part in their evolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But once it clicks, this game becomes a masterpiece. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You are a Mexican landowner trying to become the next leader of the country by toppling the nefarious leader Porfirio Diaz. You do so by acquiring land and soldiers to do your bidding, by assassinating your opposition, by controlling events in your favor and changing the political climate. Maybe you will lead the country into a bright economic future or trigger a great depression, it is all up for grabs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what if you&amp;#39;ve been beaten down? What if you&amp;#39;ve been unjustly attacked by other players&amp;#39; armies? What if your land has been taken, your allies assassinated and you&amp;#39;re left with the dregs? You&amp;#39;d be outraged, wouldn&amp;#39;t you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thus, you start courting this outrage, making your plight public. You collect outrage points, start assassinating your own cards as strawmen to show the public how dire the need is to topple this unfair dictatorship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike any other take that game, being take thatted in this one just opens up another path towards victory for you. Nobody&amp;#39;s ever out of the game in this brilliant and chaotic ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5. High Frontier&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Space Game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the one. Kerbal Space program distilled down to its nuts and bolts. High Frontier lets you colonize and industrialize space on an absolutely breathtaking map of the solar system that isn&amp;#39;t to scale, but instead based on potential energy. This game is a labor of love 30 years in the making and it shows. Not only are its systems accurate to real life specs and amazingly easy to get the hang of once you get over the initial hurdle, it is also a tightly designed competitive game that holds up to many repeat plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here&amp;#39;s the secret: Everyone makes this out to be a dry, serious, scientific, educational rocket game. And that&amp;#39;s part of it, sure. But what they don&amp;#39;t tell you: The end game turns into crazy speculative sci-fi. Things that can happen are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Terraforming Venus by throwing a giant rock at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leaving the solar system in a massive generation starship&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Becoming the supreme cult leader &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Destroying Earth by throwing an asteroid at it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Emancipation of all robots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The creating of great amounts of anti matter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leading a revolution on Earth&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a black hole&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And many more. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s a long game, but worth every second of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Sidereal Confluence&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What a title, huh? I wouldn&amp;#39;t pay it too much mind. They probably just realized Cosmic Encounter was taken. And it does look like Cosmic Encounter at first, what with the asymmetric constellation of different alien factions that players can take control of. But it turns out to be a very different beast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While both games have negotiation at their core, there are a lot of important differences to note. In Cosmic Encounter, you negotiate alliances during attacks, the space for negotiation is limited and mostly amounts to whom to gang up on. In Sidereal Confluence meanwhile, negotiation is constant and at the heart of the game. It&amp;#39;s all about trade, and everything goes. Future deals are binding! What other game lets you do that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had as much fun wheeling and dealing as in this game. There is zero luck, but different player constellations mean that no game will ever play out the same, even with the same factions in play.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly, all interaction in this game is positive. Very rarely do you deliberately deny someone a trade just to hurt them, as they are a valuable trade partner and you&amp;#39;re always trying to curry favor. In fact, you actively try to help your opponents make better deals, since when they are better off, you will have more resources available through trading with them in turn, creating a positive feedback loop that feeds into itself like crazy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve heard it said that if a good player plays this game, he raises everyone&amp;#39;s end game score by about 10 points, not just his own, and it shows. I&amp;#39;ve never seen a competitive game that fosters such warm feelings towards each other amongst its players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Root&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s new, I know, but it&amp;#39;s here to stay. I&amp;#39;ve been playing prototype versions of this game since the beginning of the year, I&amp;#39;ve played it more than pretty much any other game and I still want to play it all the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike the other games in this list, I don&amp;#39;t think much more needs to be said about this one. It&amp;#39;s a well known game and the hype train is going strong right now, so I&amp;#39;m sure everybody already knows all about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cute game about animals being excellent to each other!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Spirit Island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best coop game in existence. Yes, better than Gloomhaven. It unjustly got dealt some bad reviews by The Dice Tower and Shut Up and Sit Down. This game is so massively replayable it&amp;#39;s uncanny. So many different spirits, scenarios, and adversaries, it offers endless amounts of combinations to vary up the game. It&amp;#39;s as if you could play Pandemic and decide to fight crime instead of viruses. Or maybe the whales. Whatever takes your fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fight the whales!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahem...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spirit Island is a game about island spirits (huh, whoda thunk) defending their island from colonizers. You draft cards and use them in various ways to get rid of the menace invading your island, all while coordinating with your spirit mates and lamenting the blight that is slowly taking over what used to be a wonderful natural paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This games often seems hopeless, you&amp;#39;ll have to concede some land to the invaders, the white plastic starts spreading, the level 2 invader cards come out, you have to turn over the island card to the blighted side, all seems lost, they&amp;#39;re everywhere!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then suddenly you realize you&amp;#39;ve gained enough power to remain almost blightless for a turn. Oh, and the next. Oh, and you&amp;#39;re getting fear cards left and right, helping out even more, driving the accursed invaders off your land. Level 3 invaders? Let them come, you&amp;#39;re ready! AAAHAHAH!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DIE MOTHERTRUCKERS! DIE! MUAHAHAHAHAHA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note: Get the Branch &amp;amp; Claw expansion. It doubles the power decks and most crucially adds the event deck, which is neccessary for this not to devolve into a dry puzzle game by adding some much needed uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Argent: The Consortium&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t like worker placement games. But I like this one. I&amp;#39;ve never seen anything like it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The chancellor of the magical university has decided to step down and the players are now trying to take his place. Equipped with a variety of underling mage workers with different magical powers and a starting spell, they get to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike other worker placement games, this one is extremely interactive. Push other people&amp;#39;s mages off the board (not to worry, they will get compensated for it... most of the time), push for tempo and end the round before other people can pull off all their plans, research spells, destroy rooms full of your opponents or just travel to a different plane where you can do everything you want without being caught up in all the mayhem that all the other players are causing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Who wins at the end? Well, that depends on the consortium voters in charge of electing the next chancellor. The catch? Their identities are secret. Slowly during the game you can use some actions to discover what the victory conditions of each respective game actually are. The end scoring in this game usually can&amp;#39;t be calculated in advance, as nobody has access to the whole picture (unless they invested a ton of resources into gaining this knowledge). Revealing the voters and counting up the votes in the game&amp;#39;s great reveal is the most exciting that end game scoring has ever been. A nail biter until the end.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, after a game of this, you&amp;#39;ll want to play again right away. But hey, what&amp;#39;s this? All the worker placement tiles have a back side? And hey, you&amp;#39;ve used less than half of the ones in the box in that game (Since you own the expansion. You do own the expansion, right?). So the next game is completely different! Different board layout, different voters, different spells, different magical items, different end of round bonuses, different supporters. Different... wait, the mage powers have a different backside? So not even your workers will be the same! And that&amp;#39;s without even counting the scenarios that come in the expansion. And hey, maybe the Archmage will come for a visit and leave their staff up for grabs for yet more possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like the castle of Hogwarts, shifting around, never the same. If you enjoy discovery in your games, this one has an incredible amount of variety to it. You&amp;#39;ll never have to play the same game of Argent twice (but you&amp;#39;ll want to and you can).&lt;/p&gt;

I am looking for ideas for puzzles whether they are written riddles, physical/environmental puzzles, or something else.


Currently my girlfriend is out of state. In a few months I plan to visit and ask her dad to marry her. I plan to ask her a few months after that.


My girlfriend loves escape rooms. I love board games. We started dating over a year ago, and I quickly got her into board games. Previous to her going out of state for school, we would often play boardgames together (Harry Potter Deck Builder, Pyramid Arcade, Zendo, Pandemic [Regular, Iberia, Legacy], All of the UNLOCK, Deckscape, and EXIT games, and many more) and every Sunday we would play games with my family (Viticulture, 7 Wonders, Decrypto/Codenames, Cosmic Encounter, Black Fleet, Ticket to Ride, and many more). 


**Experience/Tools**

In terms of my skills and equipment I have 0 woodworking experience or tools. I am a teacher and consider myself decently ""crafty"" and own a cricut. I live in apartment without much outdoor space, but I would be able to paint things at my parents when I visit them on the weekend to play games.

**Layout Information**

The apartment enters with a narrow hallway with a staircase immediately to the left leading to a small loft which overlooks the living room. If you don't take the staircase and instead enter the apartment you go down the hallway into a small kitchen with attached living room. My bedroom is off of the living room. There is a small loft which over looks the living room. **Any of this space is open for use.**

**Current Ideas**

* I noticed when the hallway light is on it shines through a small opening above my bedroom door an illuminates a small portion of my wall. I imagine I will have a string of numbers on that wall and a clue card will hint toward turning on the light  while everything else is dark in order to solve/illuminate only a small string of numbers which will open a lock.

* Using hidden numbers placed inside of certain lampshades to reveal codes

* I'm trying to learn how to turn photos into sounds and then implement a spectogram type of puzzle

* Imprinted paper that requires shading over with a pencil to reveal answer

I know it isn't much and quite disjointed but that's why I'm looking for your clever thoughts or ideas. What are clever or neat puzzle/riddle ideas that you all have? Do you have any ideas of how to use the loft's ability to look down onto the living room?

I'm trying to remember the name of a game that I think was coming out around the last holiday season that was similar to Gloomhaven. Its subject matter was more 30's pulp adventure, though, and some of the adventures the players went on were in some glacier environment and another in a classic island jungle type environment.

And if anyone has played this game, what are your thoughts?

Thanks everybody!

​

I'm working on a 4X boardgame. So far only in the ideation phase. To be as informed as possible I've begun reading more game rule books, not only for 4X games but that is my main interest. I've been around boardgames for several years and I think I have seen most games that are not too obscure or rare so to speak. From what I know of Clash of Cultures is the game that reminds one the most of my concept so naturally I've read that one, unfortunately haven't had a chance to play it yet. My game has resource collecting, area control, covert operations, battles and tons of unique upgrades through a set of different districts that the player can build. Small note, the majority of them are not the simple +1 type.

​

Out of the pure 4X genre I just started reading the Eclipse SD rule book and I will of course read Twilight Imperium 4E, though that game is likely way more complex but probably still very informative.

​

Anyway, what rulebooks would you recommend for 4X or related ones? Pseudo 4X games like Scythe, already played it, is fine too. Or just a rulebook of a game in general you think is important reading, likely related to area control or upgrades etc. A small note though, I don't like dice driven games so I would prefer if you would omit such games, thank you. But! If it's a 4X game with dice resolution that is important reading to me anyway!

Here are my house rules for advanced play with the Pentagram Chamber tile.  The basic idea is that certain items affect the Pentagram Chamber in different ways.  Please let me know what you think.

PENTAGRAM CHAMBER SPECIAL ITEM EFFECTS
-----

If an explorer rubs the **Idol** when exiting the Pentagram Chamber:
	The explorer may pick up the Pentagram Chamber tile and move it to any location on the board before exiting, assuming the roll is successful.  If the roll is not successful, then lose 2 sanity but keep moving.

If an explorer rolls the **Dark Dice** in the Pentagram Chamber:

	1-6: You die and go to Hell.

	0: Target explorer dies, regardless of alignment.

If an explorer does damage with the **Sacrificial Dagger** in the Pentagram Chamber:
	Add 2 to Might, lose 1 Sanity.

If an explorer does damage with the **Blood Dagger** in the Pentagram Chamber:
	Add 2 to Speed, lose 1 Sanity.

If an explorer leaves the **Music Box** open on the floor of the Pentagram Chamber:
	Haunt 57 is triggered and continues until heroes win or the Music Box is closed or removed from the Pentagram Chamber.  If another haunt is already occurring, then both haunts are happening simultaneously, and both Haunts must be defeated for heroes to win.

If an explorer discards the **Device** on the floor of the Pentagram Chamber:
	Immediately begin Haunt 32 if no haunt has already begun.
	You are the traitor.
	If a haunt has already begun, look at top card/tile of all decks, Lose 1 Sanity.

If an explorer discards the **Candle** on the floor of the Pentagram Chamber:
	Immediately begin Haunt 14 if no haunt has already begun.
	You are the traitor.
	If a haunt has already begun, ignore card penalties, gain 2 Knowledge, Lose 1 Sanity.

If an explorer discards the **Effigy** on the floor of the Pentagram Chamber:
	Immediately begin Haunt 25 if no haunt has already begun.
	You are the traitor.
	If a haunt has already begun, ignore penalties, gain 1 Might and 1 Speed, Lose 1 Sanity.

If an explorer rings the **Bell** in the Pentagram Chamber:

	0-4: The traitor can teleport any number of monsters to the Pentagram Chamber.	

	5+: Teleport any number of heroes to the Pentagram Chamber.

If an explorer discards the **Amulet of Ages** in the Pentagram Chamber:
	Ignore card penalties, you immediately wither to dust and die.

------

If an explorer is carrying the **Ceremonial Robes** in the Pentagram Chamber while doing any of the above, they can choose not to experience any or all of the effects.

&lt;p&gt;Am I a complete moron, or is there a knack to using this app?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance for any advice or links to helpful videos and such.&lt;/p&gt;

What we feel they lack is a truly comfortable place to sit and play games for long periods of time. Most LGSl, in my opinion, are too bright and sterile, but we do not expect to directly compete with them as we would not carry a large, diverse amount of stock.

The reason I'm posting here is because I want to get everyone's opinion on what they would want and expect from a place like this.

* What you make you choose a gaming lounge/café over an LGS?
* Would you want miniatures? DM screens? Battle maps and terrain? For rent or purchase?
* For Warhammer and similar games, would custom 3D battle maps be a selling point?
* Is the aesthetic important? Lighting, décor, etc.

This works moderatly fine because the quality of the videos are not very consistent. We might get into making the videos ourselves and upload those to a open plattform. We would like to get some ideas about the topic (you may answer 1. and a couple of the other question):

1. Do you use instructional videos for learning the rules of new boardgames?

2. If YES:

   1. What are good sources/channel for instructional videos?
   2. Do you prefer subdivided video (Intro, Setup, Basic rules, Advanced rules,...)?
   3. How important is that a video explains all the details? Are referals to the exceptions/details in the rules enough?
   4. What if you can choose between a rather dry explanation or a themed/commented explanation?
   5. What would you like to see in an instructional video that is not done yet or common?

3. if NO:

   1. Why are instructional videos nit useful for you?
   2. For what kind of games you may consider watching an instructional video?
   3. Do you watch reviews or other types of boardgame related content or do you like to explore everything oin your own?

Sorry, for the massive wall of questions. We are just curious about your habbits and looking for a way to contribute to the awesome boardgame community without reinventing the wheel.
Thanks alot.

Some of you may remember [this huge reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/7u9p3q/phil_eklund_explains_the_issues_hes_had_with_game/) where Phil talked about the trouble he has had with Game Salute who were working on fulfilling multiple of his Games for a KS campaign.

After this post went viral, there was an announcement of Game Salute ultimately pledging to make things right. However, with the above announcement, I am suspecting that this didn't pan out as announced.

Phil *specifically* mentions ""fulfillment debts from the previous ones"" as one of the issues - and considering Game Salute was responsible for just that - leads me to believe that their errors and mismanagement ultimately caused SMG's downfall.

A forum to sell or trade your boardgames.

##Formatting Trade Listings:

- When listing games, you MUST include this information:
  - Game Edition/year
  - Box Condition
  - Component Condition
  - any other relevant information
- Be specific! Don't exaggerate or lie about condition. We will be very strict about this, and if we have a single problem here, we are scrapping this feature, and banning the offender(s). You will leave feedback for your trade partner.
- Please list your location that you will be shipping from.
- Tags for the games in your listing:
  - [H] - Have (games you have you are willing to trade).
  - [W] - Want (games you are looking to trade for).
  - [FS] - For Sale. (If you are looking to sell the game for money). Please include details, such as an asking price.
  - [FT] - For Trade (If you are looking to trade your game for another game).

##Logistics:

- If you are interested in an offer, leave a comment under their listing, and/or PM them about a potential trade. Be civil and courteous.
- The buyer will pay the shipping costs, unless you plan to work out your own arrangements. Be mindful of geography. Use shipping tracking numbers, and share them with your trade partner.
- Shippers will refer to this guide on shipping/packaging games. Poor shipping practices are unacceptable. Use tracking numbers and communicate them with your partner!
- Both parties will leave feedback underneath the comment in the Bazaar thread. Be truthful, and blunt. (Also, it is recommended that you setup/leave trade feedback through BGG).
- Spell your items correctly, in full. (for search purposes).


**EVERYTHING IS YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!** The formatting and logistics sections above are suggestions, not enforced policy. The mods are in no-way involved in this - and we certainly do not get involved in individual disputes. Communicate with your trade partner and work things out yourselves.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; Daily Discussion and Game Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lastly, here are some of the resources available at &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are new here, be sure to check out our &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/community""&gt;Community Guidelines&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

Each page summarizes a faction including text for rules clarifications that seem to be common questions, and is a quick-reference for Riverfolk Services.  Between each faction is a Rules Reference page which summarizes Discarding, Clearing Rule, Movement and Battle.  Both main game and supplement are covered.

The Rules Reference is repeated after each faction to ease dual-sided printing.

Interesting items which fall out of inclusion on the faction boards include: Riverfolk Services, Arbiter use, Dominance checks, and minor rules clarifications.

This document has proven popular among my own group and has eased several NEW players into the game.

I&amp;#39;m fairly in the dark as far as the game goes, as is the rest of the group afaik, so I don&amp;#39;t know if he potentially got a leg up in the game by opening some of the game&amp;#39;s content prior to the whole group seeing the game for the first time.

Hey boardgamers! My girlfriend and I love playing board games together. As much as we love the less mainstream stuff, Monopoly is her favorite. So, I designed and built her a Monopoly board with a secret trapdoor which contained the ring box. I invited a bunch of friends over and showed her the board. We didn't play a full game; the intention was for it to be more presentational. She rolled some trick dice which I also made (one was all fours, one all threes), landed on chance, pulled a card that directed her to the secret compartment and told her how to open it, and there was the ring!

This idea was inspired by a post I saw on reddit about 4 years ago. I don't remember the redditor's name, but I know his imgur handle is justinlebon26.

I have recently developed a bit of a hobby that revolves around creating physical ""reskins"" of board games without changing any of the actual mechanics. Something about trying to find parallels between stories and game mechanics that work in a different settings seems really fun to me. 

For instance I'm currently working on ""reskinning""  Thanos Rising - Avengers: Infinity War with the Subspace Emissary campaign from the video game Super Smash Bros. Brawl, as the campaign of that game follows a somewhat similar plot and setup to the MCU film. I'm working on creating my own custom cards, dice, etc. to go along with it.

Are there any online communities (Reddit or otherwise) that are focused on this specific concept? I'd be interested to see similar projects people have created, but it seems like it might be kind of a niche thing to have a whole subreddit dedicated to it. I figured it couldn't hurt to ask here, thanks.

FYI this a thing I do for purely fun and for personal use, I'm not at all trying to release an actual product of an IP I don't own.

I got told to post this into here as some of you may enjoy our 3D Printed maps.

3D Printed Fantasy Maps: https://imgur.com/gallery/lG0l8yy

Bit of background and disclaimer: The link above shows off an upcoming product launch from Hobgoblin3D. I work for the company too.

Now with that said, let me geek out a little. We've been working on this project for quite some time now, mostly on our weekends because we are still in the process of fulfilling our previous Kickstarter. 

Originally, it was designed for DMs to be able to visually represent their maps and environments to players whom in turn can then physically interact with the world and point to the DM where they'd like to go.

However as we developed it we also have noticed how it would also be good for other systems and even board games! with that being said we thought we'd show it off here too as some of you may enjoy it.

As always we are looking for feedback as we still have 2 Months till the Kickstarter launch (24th of Oct if you're curious)

Equally so, if anyone's curious about 3D Printing i am more than happy to answer questions about that too :)


EDIT: Just to clarify, we as a company sell the 3D Designs for people to 3D Print at home and this system wasn't designed for Carcassone, just by happens they could possibly be used in the game haha  ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey&amp;#39;ho Everyone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Originally, it was designed for DMs to be able to visually represent their maps and environments to players whom in turn can then physically interact with the world and point to the DM where they&amp;#39;d like to go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However as we developed it we also have noticed how it would also be good for other systems and even board games! with that being said we thought we&amp;#39;d show it off here too as some of you may enjoy it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always we are looking for feedback as we still have 2 Months till the Kickstarter launch (24th of Oct if you&amp;#39;re curious)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equally so, if anyone&amp;#39;s curious about 3D Printing i am more than happy to answer questions about that too :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: Just to clarify, we as a company sell the 3D Designs for people to 3D Print at home and this system wasn&amp;#39;t designed for Carcassone, just by happens they could possibly be used in the game haha  &lt;/p&gt;

My name is Andrew Park and I'm one of the co-designers of [The Partisans: An Extra Credits/Extra Politics](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1225737959/the-partisans-an-extra-politics-extra-credits-game) board game. I know most of you already know about the [Extra Credits channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCODtTcd5M1JavPCOr_Uydg) but if you don't, definitely give them a heads up. They do a lot of looks at different subjects through the lens of *games* and *game design* including [**POLITICS!**](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhyKYa0YJ_5BMjoxHASNb0uGK_XQrUx9D)

My design partner, Nick, (u/MickMamb) will be joining us later on his lunch break to answer some questions. Luke from [Fun to 11](http://www.funto11.com/), our publisher, may also be joining us if he finds some time while he's off at PAX. 

Little background on us. Nick and I met during law school and became close friends. Though we separated after graduation, we eventually both ended up in DC where it didn't take long for Nick, a Kickstarter enthusiast, to suggest making a board game. We settled on a theme and built out. Between the two of us we've worked on supreme court races, presidential races, congressional races, and other local stuff. Nick's wife ran for congress. We've both always been very passionate about politics. It's something that, even if you ignore, impacts you enormously. 

We started designing The Partisans a little over two years ago. It started as a thought experiment to show why politicians are often not solely to blame for our gridlock. We don't think that simply electing ""better people"" is an option. Politicians are people. They respond to incentives and the incentives in the system create the results that we see. To make real progress we need to reform our system so that it better incentivizes politicians to do what's best for the country - eg gerrymandering reform, more transparency, stricter lobbying rules, campaign finance reform, more voter protections. But also people just need to recognize that their *vote does matter.*

This was our first time ever designing a game. We both really wanted to see this one through to the end and it seems like we'll get to realize that dream. *fingers crossed*. If you're interested in politics and/or like board games, you should check out our [Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1225737959/the-partisans-an-extra-politics-extra-credits-game)!

**I'll be back around noon and be here for at least 3 hours.** Nick is going to join us for a half hour when he can. Our publisher, Luke may join us from PAX at some point if anyone has questions for someone from that perspective.

# Formatting

It seems like every week some of the advice in the comments is ""you should enforce some sort of formatting"" so lets try that here.

If your list has rankings for your top 5 games, use the following structure

1. **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME 1** \- Description of why you like game 1
2. **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME 2** \- Description of why you like game 2
3. **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME 3** \- Description of why you like game 3
4. **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME 4** \- Description of why you like game 4
5. **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME 5** \- Description of why you like game 5

If your list does not have rankings, use the following structure

* **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME A** \- Description of why you like game A
* **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME B** \- Description of why you like game B
* **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME C** \- Description of why you like game C
* **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME D** \- Description of why you like game D
* **BOLD TITLE FOR GAME E** \- Description of why you like game E

Feel free to still include information about and below your list either describing it, including honorable mentions, etc. My hope is that this format doesn't increase the barrier for entry too much and makes the results easily parsed.

As usual, please use the [discussion comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9btjmo/what_are_your_top_5_party_games/e55k5al) for feedback on the top 5 lists in general, ideas for new topics, and anything else that is relevant.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is a party game to you?

ABOUT THE GAME

Rideshare Wars is a 1-4 player area control, tableau building, and resource management card game

THE GAME STORY LINE

The taxi cartel has lost its grip on the six northern cities. The day has come when it goes out of business.

You are the leader of a rideshare corporation and you are on a mission to scoop up riders left without transportation in the wake of the cartel’s collapse. But you are not the only rideshare operator in town, and so far it’s been a tight race for dominance. Today is your last chance to acquire just the right riders, and in just the right cities, in order to emerge victorious.

GAME OVERVIEW

In Rideshare Wars, players use driver cards to pay the cost to acquire rider cards. You use rider cards to build out a tableau which represents your market presence across the six northern cities. To win the game, a player must successfully navigate the balance between acquiring rider cards in as many cities as possible, whilst at the same time accumulating as many cards as possible in only two or three cities (a.k.a “piling up” riders) in order to establish control:

\- Players start out in a race to achieve market presence milestones, and earn milestone cards, by acquiring certain combinations of rider cards from as many cities as possible. The first player to collect a certain number of milestone cards instantly wins the game.

\- If no one collects enough milestone cards to snatch instant victory, the game is played over 15 rounds and the winner is determined by scoring cards in each player’s tableau...except that a player only has the right to score only rider cards in cities a player controls. You control a city if you have “piled up” the most rider cards for that city than any other player. Over the course of a game, each player accumulates “secret” rider cards that are only revealed at the end of the game, which means oftentimes you can never be too sure that you will have the right to score a particular city until it’s time for final scoring.

Rider cards come in a variety of values and card powers. Generally, low value rider cards have beneficial powers whilst high value cards have adverse powers. As players acquire riders, their starting supply of driver cards eventually starts to run out. Players have multiple ways of generating additional drivers, with some ways being more efficient than others.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In Myrmes, originally shown under the name ANTerpryse, players control ant colonies and use their ants to explore the land (leaving pheromones in their wake); harvest ""crops"" like stone, earth and aphids; fight with other ants; complete requests from the Queen; birth new ants; and otherwise dominate their tiny patch of dirt, all in a quest to score points and prove that they belong at the top of the heap, er, anthill. After three seasons of scrabbling and foraging, each ant colony faces a harsh winter that will test its colonial strength.

In game terms, each player has an individual game board to track what's going on inside his colony – that is, whether the nurses are tending to larvae or doing other things, where the larvae are in their growth process, what resources the colony has, which actions are available to workers when they leave the colony, and so on. The shared game board shows the landscape outside the exit tunnel that all colonies share; after exiting this tunnel, workers ants can move over the terrain to place pheromones (which gives them access to resource cubes), clean up empty pheromones (to make space), hunt prey (by discarding soldiers) or place special tiles (but only if they've developed the ant colony).

The game lasts three years, and at the start of each year three season dice are rolled to determine the event for each season: extra larvae or soldiers, more VPs for actions, and so on. Within each season, players can spend larvae to adjust the event for themselves on their personal player board. (Put the kids to work!) After adjusting the event, player allocate nurses to birth larvae, worker or soldier ants or to use them for other actions. The worker ants then do their thing, working within the colony itself (although only one colony level is open initially) or traveling to the outside world to hunt prey (ladybugs, termites, spiders), lay down pheromones (which later lets them claim resources on these spaces), place special tiles (like an aphid farm or sub-colony), or clear out pheromones left by ants from any colony. After harvesting, nurses who didn't tend to births then take additional actions, such as opening a new tunnel that only your colony can use, clearing a new level within your colony, or meeting one of the six objectives (capture a certain number of prey, build special tiles, and so on) laid out at the start of the game.

After three seasons, players must pay food to get their colony through winter, losing points if they can't. Whoever has the most points after three years wins. All hail our new ant overlords!

I've just posted a massive pictorial review that covers all the differences over on BoardGameGeek:

[https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2051434](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2051434)

You'll find all the details there, but here are the key points:

**Rule changes**

The main changes with the anniversary edition are upgrades to the components rather than the rules, but there are rule changes on two points:

1. Income freezes upon reaching end of score-track

2. Four Services Bounties available at start of game

**Component changes**

Here's a complete list of all the things that have changed from the 2010 printing of the game in the 10th anniversary edition:

1. *Improved box*: The game box has much thicker and sturdier side walls, is larger in height so that it can fit more contents, and has thumb tabs for easy removal.

2. *Improved box insert*: The box insert has a removable tray for storing the bonds and money, and extra compartments so you can include storage of expansion cards.

3. *Revised maps*: The Eastern US and Mexico maps both have all new artwork, clearer text, fixed hexes, and have undergone a complete upgrade. A border on the edge of the map does make Transcontinental games less optimal.

4. *New water hex icons*: All hexes that require an extra cost due to water are clearly marked with a water droplet icon, similar to how mountain hexes are marked a white dot.

5. *Improved Major Lines*: Not only is there a clear Major Line chart on all maps (sorted in order of point value), but the start and end point of Major Lines are marked on the cities themselves with matching alphabet letters (e.g. A, B, C etc).

6. *Improved round &amp; turn order tracks*: The tracks on the board for keeping track of turn order and rounds have been upgraded and improved.

7. *Improved cloth bag*: The cloth bag for the goods cubes is now a larger, more beautiful, and high quality velvet feel black bag, screen printed with the game name in gold.

8. *Revised empty city markers*: Instead of city markers of four types, there are 20 identical markers with a design sculpted with a \`ghost town' feel.

9. *Improved score track*: This now has a snake-like design, with clearer numbers and figures, and the lowest income at the end is $10.

10. *New scoring discs*: Instead of needing to use trains for scoring, there are stackable wooden score discs in all the player colours.

11. *Revised train colours*: A slight colour adjustment has been made to avoid them being identified with the colours of goods cubes and cities.

12. *Revised banknote colours*: The currency colours have been adjusted to make the different denominations more clearly distinct in low light.

13. *Revised game cards*: Many revisions have been made to the Railroad Operation cards and the Baron cards, mostly with added clarifications to avoid misunderstandings by players.

14. *Revised bonds*: The bonds cards are are slightly smaller, and have a rectangular rather than square shape.

15. *New city name on Hotel and Service Bounty cards*: The city name of these cards is part of the title, making these cards stackable and easier to read.

16. *Revised player reference cards*: These cards have been redone and improved, with Major Lines on one side and player actions on the other, including clarifications.

17. *Revised colour-matching*: The colours of the cities have been altered from the previous version, but the cities, new city markers, and goods cubes are all an exact colour match, including blue and purple. It just means they won't be an exact match with previous versions of the game.

18. *Revised expansion maps* : All the expansion boards have been reprinted (besides Railways Through Time), to make sure their city colours are an exact match to the components of the new base game.

19. *Revised comprehensive rule book*: Includes updates and clarifications, and gives information for the base game and all expansions, rather than separate booklets for each expansion.

**Recommendation**

That's a long list of upgrades, and the publishers have done a fantastic job with this new version of the game; virtually all the changes that have been made are upgrades. Many of them are small, but they all make the playing experience clearer and better. With the 10th anniversary edition, Railways of the World has really progressed to the next level, and everything is really an improvement in every way. A large team of people have been involved in making this anniversary edition and have put a huge amount of work into a project that they love, and the quality of the final product proves it. 

I think we can safely say that now we do have a definitive version of the game, and that new players can go out and get the 10th anniversary edition with confidence, knowing that they are getting a shiny new version of a game that has been enjoyed for a decade already, but now has the benefit of some serious polish to the rules and components.

My favourite game now has an absolutely amazing edition, and I can't recommend this highly enough!

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New scoring discs&lt;/em&gt;: Instead of needing to use trains for scoring, there are stackable wooden score discs in all the player colours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised train colours&lt;/em&gt;: A slight colour adjustment has been made to avoid them being identified with the colours of goods cubes and cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised banknote colours&lt;/em&gt;: The currency colours have been adjusted to make the different denominations more clearly distinct in low light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised game cards&lt;/em&gt;: Many revisions have been made to the Railroad Operation cards and the Baron cards, mostly with added clarifications to avoid misunderstandings by players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised bonds&lt;/em&gt;: The bonds cards are are slightly smaller, and have a rectangular rather than square shape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;New city name on Hotel and Service Bounty cards&lt;/em&gt;: The city name of these cards is part of the title, making these cards stackable and easier to read.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised player reference cards&lt;/em&gt;: These cards have been redone and improved, with Major Lines on one side and player actions on the other, including clarifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised colour-matching&lt;/em&gt;: The colours of the cities have been altered from the previous version, but the cities, new city markers, and goods cubes are all an exact colour match, including blue and purple. It just means they won&amp;#39;t be an exact match with previous versions of the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised expansion maps&lt;/em&gt; : All the expansion boards have been reprinted (besides Railways Through Time), to make sure their city colours are an exact match to the components of the new base game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Revised comprehensive rule book&lt;/em&gt;: Includes updates and clarifications, and gives information for the base game and all expansions, rather than separate booklets for each expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Recommendation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s a long list of upgrades, and the publishers have done a fantastic job with this new version of the game; virtually all the changes that have been made are upgrades. Many of them are small, but they all make the playing experience clearer and better. With the 10th anniversary edition, Railways of the World has really progressed to the next level, and everything is really an improvement in every way. A large team of people have been involved in making this anniversary edition and have put a huge amount of work into a project that they love, and the quality of the final product proves it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think we can safely say that now we do have a definitive version of the game, and that new players can go out and get the 10th anniversary edition with confidence, knowing that they are getting a shiny new version of a game that has been enjoyed for a decade already, but now has the benefit of some serious polish to the rules and components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favourite game now has an absolutely amazing edition, and I can&amp;#39;t recommend this highly enough! &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NB: &lt;em&gt;For lots of photos, and much more information on the new edition, see the full review on BGG here&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;[&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href=""https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2051434""&gt;&lt;strong&gt;link&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;strong&gt;]&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Our first wedding anniversary is coming up and it being the paper/cardboard anniversary I thought it would be a great excuse to get her a personalized boardgame as a gift! We had our honeymoon in Santorini so it was a perfect candidate. This was my first real attempt at painting minis and overall I'm happy with the result so I thought I share.

* For the characters I used the colour of her wedding dress (champagne), the colour she picked out for our bedroom (seafoam green) and the colour of her favorite sweater (purplish).
* I bought some tiny 1.5 mm cubic zircon stud earings, clipped them down and inset them into holes I drilled in the womans hand to simulate an engagement ring. I also painted a tiny gold band on the mans ring finger but it's almost impossible to see.
* I tried to paint them in our likeness as much as possible, matching hair/eye colours and freckles.

If you zoom in you can see a lot of little mistakes, but the minis are deceptively small so it's hard to see that level of detail in person. I had a heck of a time getting the toner to not look all blotchy (purple guy is the worst) and is is really hard to do eyes!

I have been in the hobby for five years now.

I traded few games over the years, but first one I bought (The Lord of the rings LCG) is still there.

Only thing I would change (except more games) is that I wish I got 5x5 shelf as this one is done. 

I asked my wife to get Charterstone, and she said ""Get it if you can fit it in the shelf. Not on the shelf, but in the shelf."" 

I still don't have Charterstone :)

My favourite game is Concordia (while Blood rage, Scythe and Raiders of the north sea are up there with it)

The one game that is special is This War of Mine as it is, somewhat, based on the siege of Sarajevo that I have lived through. I wrote a review of it, and if you want you can find it here:

Currently I am looking at a November &amp;quot;promise&amp;quot; instead of the August delivery date that was given at the time of order.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I see many posts on their facebook account - but they are all from the company.  And are supposedly posts from happy customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really like the product - and am hoping it&amp;#39;s simply just delays and demand.  However, I am not finding anywhere where people are posting complaints about delayed delivery - which has my spidey sense tingling.  Are there others waiting for their table?  How long?  Are their others here on Reddit who have taken delivery?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks&lt;/p&gt;

And it seems like the fulfillment of the Kickstarter has been less-than-desirable.

On top of that, though I don't know the details, the game has been in the process of being sold and transferred to another company, so there's been very little communication to the backers as to what's going on.

I've recently found -  and become enamored with - the Commands and Colors Series by GMT. As a HUGE Total War PC game fan, I'd longed for a game that gave you that tactical battlefield feel, with the closest I'd found being War of the Ring, though that is more strategic than tactical.

Recently, a recommendation for Space Empires 4x turned me onto hex and counter games, ultimately leading me to discover the Commands and Colors series.

These games totally capture the Total War PC feel, putting you in charge of famous armies throughout many historical scenarios. Some of the scenarios are inherently unbalanced (like real life!) but you can always play twice against your opponent and switch sides, scoring each game to determine the final winner.

I've got the Napoleonic version, but unfortunately many of the versions are out of print and currently in P500 at GMT.  I'm in line for C and C: Ancients (Romans) and C and C: Samurai Battles (which I'm hoping is going to play just like Shogun: Total War, one of my all time favorite PC games). 

I'd love to hear others thoughts on the C and C series and recommendations for similar games. Also, diving into GMT games has introduced me to VASSAL (a computer program to play board games online for those who don't know). Do any of you know of a way to meetup and play specific games with others on VASSAL? I have some board game friends locally, but struggle getting things like C and C to the table.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve recently found -  and become enamored with - the Commands and Colors Series by GMT.

I need help from a gaming math geek. I have reason to suspect that there might be some in this sub. :P

What I am trying to figure out is all the possible combinations of die results that can be used to get any pair of numbers in Can't Stop.

For instance, to get a 2,2 there is only one possible roll: 1,1,1,1.

For 2,3 it could be 1,1,1,2 or 1,1,2,1 or 1,2,1,1 or 2,1,1,1 - four possible rolls.

...and from here it ramps up dramatically, and figuring it out this way is just not going to cut it. I am sure there is some formula or pattern that can be used, but I am too stupid and uneducated to figure it out.

I note some web sites give ""odds"" for Can't Stop, but either I don't understand them or it is not what I need. FWIW, this is not really about Can't Stop, I am not trying to figure strategies or percentages.

I love Viticulture but I completely disagree with the sentiment that the expanded board should be played with at all times or is ""necessary"".

Some background. I purchased Viticulture almost immediately after the essential edition came out. Probably played it about 20 or so times. One of the few euro/work placement games my lady enjoys. I bought Tuscany: EE a few months ago. I have played it with her as well as some other people maybe 4-5 times now. We've only used the expanded board module so far. I feel that the expanded board lengthens the game to a point where it might just overstay its welcome. I also feel that the wake up track is actually worse with the expanded board. Every game we've played  people were jockeying for the 7th position since the bonus' are quite powerful then you get to be in the first position next round. The original wakeup track had more freedom I felt.

&lt;p&gt;I love Viticulture but I completely disagree with the sentiment that the expanded board should be played with at all times or is &amp;quot;necessary&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some background. I purchased Viticulture almost immediately after the essential edition came out. Probably played it about 20 or so times. One of the few euro/work placement games my lady enjoys. I bought Tuscany: EE a few months ago. I have played it with her as well as some other people maybe 4-5 times now. We&amp;#39;ve only used the expanded board module so far. I feel that the expanded board lengthens the game to a point where it might just overstay its welcome. I also feel that the wake up track is actually worse with the expanded board. Every game we&amp;#39;ve played  people were jockeying for the 7th position since the bonus&amp;#39; are quite powerful then you get to be in the first position next round. The original wakeup track had more freedom I felt.&lt;/p&gt;

We're going to let customers play almost any game on our shelves for just a one-time 5 dollar Play Pass. We're excluding legacy games and expansions, but we hope that this will bring people into the store instead of just ordering online.

Thanks in advance!

So I have decided to attempt one a week. I'll most often post on Wednesday as my game group plays on Tues. I won't always be posting about new games, but I'll try to lean more in that direction. So, without further ado, here are 10 things you should know (maybe I'll shorten it to 10TYSK):

1. Each game will take you at least 3 hours if you're playing with a group. If you can't get that kind of game time for the 5 cases, this game might not be for you.

2. The cases are somewhat connected. For example, Case 2 is directly connected to Case 1 and there's an overarching plot you'll slowly uncover. If you wait several weeks in between cases, you may miss/forget some details that you might have remembered by playing it sooner. If you can't play it fairly regularly, you'll need to have good notes.

3. Once you beat this game, it's highly unlikely you'll play it again. So if it bothers you to spend ~$35-40 on a one-shot game that only offers 5 plays, you may want to split the cost up among your group or pass on this game.

4. The flavor text of the cards is not super interesting. A lot of it is just boring stuff like ""waited in traffic"" ""drank terrible coffee"" or ""sat in a chair after filling out paperwork applications."" Personally, I don't have a problem with this because I think it describes much of what police working is like. But if you want menacing details like in Arkham Horror, you won't find it.

5. The box components is nothing worth getting excited about. You'll open it up and see the smallest game board you've ever seen in your life, 5 decks of cards (35 cards each), 2 books (one rules, one cases), and a smattering of tokens and pieces. The quality is fine, but there's not an abundance of stuff.

6. You will need a computer, tablet, or phone to play the game. There is a website that you have to create an account on in order to do each case. The website is where you'll receive files on persons of interest, interrogation transcriptions, and most fun of all, the lab ""signatures"": materials, fingerprints, and DNA analyses. You will also need someone who is a good notetaker. And you will have to do a LOT of out loud reading if you're part of a group.

7. Detective creates a superior experience to any other detective board game. If you enjoy Sherlock Holmes, I think you'll LOVE Detective. The website and time function add to the experience and gameplay making each case taut and tense. The cases are well designed and solvable. However, with the time spent on each case, it could be very frustrating if you think you've solved it and haven't, because you'll have to beat it in order to progress to the next case.

8. If you follow the rules, you'll be forced to make tough choices. One of the great things about the game is that you can't follow every lead. You have constantly stay focused on your main objectives, deciding whether or not to dig deeper and spend precious trait tokens, and whether or not to pursue certain leads near the end of the day and risk gaining too much stress. 

9. The payoff of solving the cases is extremely high. Getting matches on suspects you think are guilty and having evidence to prove it is a great thrill. I always end each case thinking maybe I should have become a detective. There's a wonderful joy in this game that many co-operative games don't really provide.

10. You'll likely never get a perfect score because there's not enough time to pursue every angle you want to pursue. If you're a perfectionist or a completist, it might drive you crazy. Of course, you can always ignore the stress aspect and miss out on that level of gameplay if you want to, but I think you might be cutting yourself short of the tough choices the game has to offer. Do I think this game is for everyone? No. But I do think it's for everyone who enjoys solving puzzles and/or playing games with strong narratives. My hope is that the publishers are already working on the next several cases to be released as a cheap expansion pack of cards.

EDIT: 

[10TYSK: Villainous](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9a9j84/10_things_you_need_to_know_before_buying/)","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week I posted 10 things you should know before buying Villainous, and someone in the comments asked me if I could start doing these more often. So I have decided to attempt one a week. I&amp;#39;ll most often post on Wednesday as my game group plays on Tues. I won&amp;#39;t always be posting about new games, but I&amp;#39;ll try to lean more in that direction. So, without further ado, here are 10 things you should know (maybe I&amp;#39;ll shorten it to 10TYSK):&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each game will take you at least 3 hours if you&amp;#39;re playing with a group. If you can&amp;#39;t get that kind of game time for the 5 cases, this game might not be for you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are somewhat connected. For example, Case 2 is directly connected to Case 1 and there&amp;#39;s an overarching plot you&amp;#39;ll slowly uncover. If you wait several weeks in between cases, you may miss/forget some details that you might have remembered by playing it sooner. If you can&amp;#39;t play it fairly regularly, you&amp;#39;ll need to have good notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you beat this game, it&amp;#39;s highly unlikely you&amp;#39;ll play it again. So if it bothers you to spend ~$35-40 on a one-shot game that only offers 5 plays, you may want to split the cost up among your group or pass on this game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flavor text of the cards is not super interesting. A lot of it is just boring stuff like &amp;quot;waited in traffic&amp;quot; &amp;quot;drank terrible coffee&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;sat in a chair after filling out paperwork applications.&amp;quot; Personally, I don&amp;#39;t have a problem with this because I think it describes much of what police working is like. But if you want menacing details like in Arkham Horror, you won&amp;#39;t find it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

This week's Meeple of the Week is /u/CommaDelimited

#**Real life**
**How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?** 

I started playing games at an early age with my parents. We'd usually have game nights once a week or so. Our most commonly played games were Risk, Frontier Six, Rummy, Milles Bornes and a handful of other games. It wasn't until about 10 years ago that I got back into gaming, thanks to a friend who introduced my wife and I to Ticket to Ride.

#**Gaming habits**

**Do you customize your games? If so, can you describe one of the games you customized?**  

I don't generally customize my games, but I have done so for a few. I've built foam core inserts for Lords of Vegas and King of Tokyo, and upgraded Lords of Vegas to use poker chips instead of paper money, but that's about it.

**How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?** 

I generally play at least once or twice a week. My most common gaming partners are my 4 children (ages 5 - 12). I try to schedule game nights with a small group of friends perhaps once a month. I also run a regular gaming event here in Nashville which gives me occasion to play with a much wider group of people.

**Do you have a BGG profile you'd like to share?**

Sure thing! It's [https://boardgamegeek.com/user/commadelimited](https://boardgamegeek.com/user/commadelimited)

&amp;nbsp;

#**Favorites**


**What is your Favorite Game and why?** 

If you ask me what game I'd play with no hesitation it might be Battle Sheep from Blue Orange. If instead you ask a game I'd like to play more I'd probably say Russian Railroads.

**Favorite gateway game?**

I'm a really big fan of Seeland. It's relatively lightweight, but it has an interesting theme and components.  

**Who is your Favorite Designer and why?** 

I love J. Alex Kevern. I think his games are unique, interesting, and challenging. 

**Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?** 

I love Renegade Games. They consistently put out quality games with diverse themes, artwork, and mechanisms.

**Favorite gaming mechanism?**

Would probably be a toss up between set collection or worker placement.

**What game can you not stand or refuse to play?** 

I'll never turn down a game of Las Vegas.

#**Q &amp; A**

**Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?**

I only rate games in batches. The last time I went through and rated my collection was about 2 years ago. I've given a 10 rating to only 6 games, out of the hundreds of different games I've played. To me a 10 means that you think the game is just about perfect. No glaring flaws, you'll play it any time, and you'll share it with your friends.


**Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?**

I think there's some important differences between the two styles. I'm definitely not an Ameritrash gamer, but I also don't think I'm a real euro gamer either. Many of the games I like don't properly fall into either category. I do lean towards the euro gamer aesthetic though. I love wooden pieces of all types.


**What does /r/boardgames mean to you?**

I think it's a vibrant community full of people who are passionate about board games. Exciting really.

**What is your favorite kind of /r/boardgames post?**

I enjoy it when people post things they're excited about: a game, making their own gaming table, painting minis, etc.

**What are your thoughts on crowdfunding board games? What's your favorite crowdfunded game?**

I think the board game hobby wouldn't be in the position it's in today without crowdfunding. It empowers creators to publish games that would never have seen the light of day before. Many of those games wind up being failures, but we also have plenty of examples of oustanding sucesses: Lanterns, Zombicide (and many of the other CMON games), and XYZ.


**How many games are in your collection? Are you satisfied with that number?** 

I currently have about 250 games in my collection. And that's after only 4-5 years of collecting. I'm happy with that number, even though I expect it to continually increase. Thankfully I no longer think I need to own every game I'm interested in.



**If you could only keep 10 games in your collection, what 10 would they be?** 

Oh man. I'd probably have to break it down to only 1 of each type or genre. That list would probably look something like:

- Battle Sheep  
- Kingdomino  
- Five Crowns  
- Las Vegas  
- Hamsterrolle  
- Strike  
- Russian Railroads  
- Ticket to Ride  
- Kahuna  
- Rattus
 


**Is there anything else you'd like to add?** 

•Play games with your kids. Teach them deduction, reasoning, and fair play.  
•Get involved in a gaming group in your community. If there's not one, start one.  
•Check out [MeepleMountain.com](www.meeplemountain.com) for board game reviews and articles.  

#**Questions from a previous Meeple of the Week**

**Do you enjoy solo gaming?**

I tried solo gaming for a bit, but I realized I just didn't enjoy gaming alone. Part of what makes gaming important for me is being able to share it with the people I love, or even strangers for that matter. That said I'm thrilled that more publishers are including solo play in their titles. I realize plenty of people enjoy solo gaming, for a number of reasons, and that allows those people to be engaged in the same hobby I am! It's a win for everyone.

**What do you feel is important about fostering a sense of community in board games?**

The most important thing is to remember that board games are for everyone. Toss aside any preconceived notions of who a ""board gamer"" is, and what sorts of games they should be playing. Don't try to be a ""gatekeeper"", and don't let anyone else be one either. The thing I most appreciate about board games is how they connect us. The fact that a few colored slices of tree can bring people together is just amazing.

[Past Meeples of the Week](/r/boardgames/wiki/meeple_of_the_week)
","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greetings board gamers! In an effort to spotlight some standout members of the &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; community, we present to you the Meeple of the Week! Every week we&amp;#39;ll be interviewing Reddit board gamers and presenting their profiles so you can get to know them better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s Meeple of the Week is &lt;a href=""/u/CommaDelimited""&gt;/u/CommaDelimited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Real life&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started playing games at an early age with my parents. We&amp;#39;d usually have game nights once a week or so. Our most commonly played games were Risk, Frontier Six, Rummy, Milles Bornes and a handful of other games. It wasn&amp;#39;t until about 10 years ago that I got back into gaming, thanks to a friend who introduced my wife and I to Ticket to Ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gaming habits&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you customize your games? If so, can you describe one of the games you customized?&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t generally customize my games, but I have done so for a few. I&amp;#39;ve built foam core inserts for Lords of Vegas and King of Tokyo, and upgraded Lords of Vegas to use poker chips instead of paper money, but that&amp;#39;s about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I generally play at least once or twice a week. My most common gaming partners are my 4 children (ages 5 - 12). I try to schedule game nights with a small group of friends perhaps once a month. I also run a regular gaming event here in Nashville which gives me occasion to play with a much wider group of people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a BGG profile you&amp;#39;d like to share?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure thing! It&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/user/commadelimited""&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/user/commadelimited&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your Favorite Game and why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you ask me what game I&amp;#39;d play with no hesitation it might be Battle Sheep from Blue Orange. If instead you ask a game I&amp;#39;d like to play more I&amp;#39;d probably say Russian Railroads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gateway game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m a really big fan of Seeland. It&amp;#39;s relatively lightweight, but it has an interesting theme and components.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is your Favorite Designer and why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love J. Alex Kevern. I think his games are unique, interesting, and challenging. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love Renegade Games. They consistently put out quality games with diverse themes, artwork, and mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Favorite gaming mechanism?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Would probably be a toss up between set collection or worker placement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What game can you not stand or refuse to play?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll never turn down a game of Las Vegas.
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Versus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th align=""right""&gt;Fight!&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Unsleeved&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Short&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;Race for the Galaxy vs. Roll for the Galaxy&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Roll&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;War vs. Peace&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Peace&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;Meeple vs. Mountain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Mountain&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td align=""right""&gt;Words vs. Video&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Video&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only rate games in batches. The last time I went through and rated my collection was about 2 years ago. I&amp;#39;ve given a 10 rating to only 6 games, out of the hundreds of different games I&amp;#39;ve played. To me a 10 means that you think the game is just about perfect. No glaring flaws, you&amp;#39;ll play it any time, and you&amp;#39;ll share it with your friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there&amp;#39;s some important differences between the two styles. I&amp;#39;m definitely not an Ameritrash gamer, but I also don&amp;#39;t think I&amp;#39;m a real euro gamer either. Many of the games I like don&amp;#39;t properly fall into either category. I do lean towards the euro gamer aesthetic though. I love wooden pieces of all types.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;#39;s a vibrant community full of people who are passionate about board games. Exciting really.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is your favorite kind of &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; post?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I enjoy it when people post things they&amp;#39;re excited about: a game, making their own gaming table, painting minis, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on crowdfunding board games? What&amp;#39;s your favorite crowdfunded game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the board game hobby wouldn&amp;#39;t be in the position it&amp;#39;s in today without crowdfunding. It empowers creators to publish games that would never have seen the light of day before. Many of those games wind up being failures, but we also have plenty of examples of oustanding sucesses: Lanterns, Zombicide (and many of the other CMON games), and XYZ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;Las Vegas&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hamsterrolle&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strike&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Russian Railroads&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ticket to Ride&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Kahuna&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rattus&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you&amp;#39;d like to add?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;•Play games with your kids. Teach them deduction, reasoning, and fair play.&lt;br/&gt;

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

The woods are old-growth, dappled with sunlight. Delicious mushrooms beckon from every grove and hollow. Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you sauté them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.

Morels, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms – sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough – earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.

Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.

Below is [the original Game of the Week post](/1lcjf7) from August 29th, 2013:

------------------

##[Coup]( http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/131357/coup)

* **Designer:** Rikki Tahta

* **Publisher:** was recently picked up by Indie Boards and Cards

* **Year Released:** 2012

* **Game Mechanic:** Bluffing, Hand Management, Player Elimination, Variable Player Powers

* **Number of Players:** 2-6 (best with 5; recommended 3-6)

* **Playing Time:** 15 minutes

Coup is a card game in which the last player with influence wins.  Players each have two facedown cards that can correspond to one of five different characters, each with a unique power that allow a player to take one of many different actions.  The trick is, a player doesn’t necessarily have to possess the corresponding card to take the action; player’s announce what action they are taking and, if unopposed, they take it.  If opposed, the player that was incorrect loses an influence and must turn one of their cards face up.  If both of a player’s characters are face up, they lose the game.  Influence corresponds to face down cards so the last player with a face down card is the winner.

Notes:

1. This is a try-to-be-exhaustive list of apps, not a list of recommended apps. They are ordered by BGG ranks. I only include ""official"" apps. Oldies like Chess, Go, Backgammon or playing-card games are omitted. I removed some reportedly extremely buggy apps. I also leave out some great digital boardgames that do not have a physical version (i.e. no BGG entry).
2. The list is based on Google play manual searches, [this geeklisk](https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/72020/android-versions-actual-boardgames) on BGG, and digital boardgame review site [Pixelated Cardboard](https://www.pixelatedcardboard.com/).
3. I've played 73 out of 126 games above. Most are paid apps. I don't plan to give recommendations (at least not in this original post). I can say that most of the games I played are worthy of the purchase. In general, look for games that are well-maintained (last update within 1 year), no recent complaints of bugs in Play Store review (sort by new), and avoid those free ""classic"" big-company games which are monetized by bad IAP.
4. Boardgame apps are the hidden gems of mobile games. Look for games that have online async capability or single-player campaign. If you are interested in anything on the above list, add the game to your wishlist first. There are frequent discounts! (I think 70% of my games are bought with discount)
5. Let me know if I miss any worthy game!

Edit: thanks for the gold!! Can I take this opportunity to ask dev to make apps for great boardgames that suffer from AP at high player count? Power Grid, Five Tribes, Tzolkin, etc. (Castle of Burgundy too but it is being developed already) Async multiplayer would be great for these games!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I suddenly want to make a complete list of Android boardgame apps. So I made this. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;This is a try-to-be-exhaustive list of apps, not a list of recommended apps. They are ordered by BGG ranks. I only include &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; apps. Oldies like Chess, Go, Backgammon or playing-card games are omitted. I removed some reportedly extremely buggy apps. I also leave out some great digital boardgames that do not have a physical version (i.e. no BGG entry).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The list is based on Google play manual searches, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/geeklist/72020/android-versions-actual-boardgames""&gt;this geeklisk&lt;/a&gt; on BGG, and digital boardgame review site &lt;a href=""https://www.pixelatedcardboard.com/""&gt;Pixelated Cardboard&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I&amp;#39;ve played 73 out of 126 games above. Most are paid apps. I don&amp;#39;t plan to give recommendations (at least not in this original post). I can say that most of the games I played are worthy of the purchase. In general, look for games that are well-maintained (last update within 1 year), no recent complaints of bugs in Play Store review (sort by new), and avoid those free &amp;quot;classic&amp;quot; big-company games which are monetized by bad IAP.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Boardgame apps are the hidden gems of mobile games. Look for games that have online async capability or single-player campaign. If you are interested in anything on the above list, add the game to your wishlist first. There are frequent discounts! (I think 70% of my games are bought with discount)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Let me know if I miss any worthy game!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: thanks for the gold!! Can I take this opportunity to ask dev to make apps for great boardgames that suffer from AP at high player count? Power Grid, Five Tribes, Tzolkin, etc. (Castle of Burgundy too but it is being developed already) Async multiplayer would be great for these games!&lt;/p&gt;

https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/99webz/what_are_your_top_5_games_of_all_time/

I went through and organized the 500+ posts into a Google spreadsheet.

https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kgzZUsbUxgoxS3ntgVWl6P8iutwq197OxEv9URiEASI/

This would have been a lot easier to do if submissions for these top 5 posts were always in a fixed format.

1. first game
2. second game
3. third game
4. fourth game
5. fifth game

Anyway, I digress.

There were 395 unique games submitted. The number would have been much more than 400 if I had included ""Honorable Mention"" games. I also didn't include any games that were 6+ in a particular post since the question was about the top 5.

Approximately 50% of the games were only nominated by 1 person. The number of games nominated by only 2 people was nearly another 25%.

Here are the top games that received 10 or more nominations:

* Scythe - 30
* Spirit Island - 29
* Gloomhaven - 28
* Concordia - 23
* Carcassonne - 22
* Terraforming Mars - 22
* Agricola - 21
* Twilight Struggle - 21
* Twilight Imperium - 16
* Viticulture EE with Tuscany EE - 16
* Cosmic Encounter - 15
* Dominion - 15
* Race for the Galaxy - 15
* Pandemic - 14
* Great Western Trail - 13
* Pandemic Legacy - 13
* The Resistance/Avalon - 13

* Blood Rage - 10
* Five Tribes - 10
* Mage Knight - 10
* Magic: The Gathering - 10
* Roll for the Galaxy - 10
* Tigris and Euphrates - 10

Note: If I had lumped Pandemic and Pandemic: Legacy together, it would have had 27 nominations.

I attempted to cover the items that fall out of the general faction order, as well as present common clarifications, such as Rule order, Discard rules, Movement and Battle summaries, custom per faction page.

Items which fall out of faction order include Riverfolk Services, Arbiter use, and Dominance checks, among other smaller nuances.

This is a cleaned up cheat-sheet that my group has been using for our sessions. We had some new players who couldn't cope with some of the rules being a bit out of synch, and the interactions between factions not being globally available without memorization.

BGG : https://www.boardgamegeek.com/filepage/168371/ (v1.3 is uploading; BGG upload API is wacky)

Please let me know whether I've captured all relevant rules. 
Forgive the design; I'm not a layout artist. 
Advice and feedback appreciated.
I would like to know where I can improve these, including missing rules and removal of lesser text to increase whitespace.

I try to bring over stuff that's relatively simple for people who don't play board games and I'm starting to feel like they're just saying a game looks/ is complicated out of laziness. 


Some examples of games I've tried to show them that are simple are Ticket to Ride, and Battle Wizards Duel at mount Skullzfyre. The rules and mechanics are simple but they just dismiss it with it looks complicated or sounds complicated when I explain the rules even with a demonstration. I've been hoping to get them eventually up to where they may be willing to try something with a bit more depth like fury of dracula or eldritch horror but it doesn't look viable. Do you guys have any advice on getting people to try new games or stories similar to what I'm going through? I'd love to hear from you guys. Also I apologize if I selected the wrong flair. 


EDIT: Holy crap this blew up more than I was expecting. Thank you everyone for the advice you all have been sharing. I think I'm going to just let them enjoy Betrayal for the time being and see if I can find others that are more into exploring new and different games.

I played Brass: Birmingham over the weekend and have to say it was quite possibly the best game I’ve ever played. 

We played with a group of 4, all of whom have never played it nor the original. We watched the “Watch it Played” video together, remarked that the video took almost as long as our entire game of Container, and then felt ready to go. I felt that we were pretty solid getting through it for first timers, after set up the game only took 90 minutes. We only got 1 rule wrong the entire game and it wasn’t so much “Wrong” as we just forgot something “Special” with a card type. We all forgot until the very end that if you use a city card, you can play an industry in that city without it being connected to your grid. We kept adding to our grids and might have missed some opportunity. There were some obtuseness to the rules such as constantly having to remember the distinction between “The” Grid, “Your” Grid and being “Connected” and every resource needing a unique combination of those 3 terms, but we had it under control after a while

About 30-40 minutes before the game ended I was starting at the board thinking “This is amazing. Absolutely amazing, this is one of the best gaming experiences I’ve ever had”. I was completely in love with how organically the board state was unfolding and the decisions I had the opportunity to make. The theme and components did such a good job of pulling me in and the possibility space of the game was brilliant. It’s the type of game that constantly adjusts based on what people are doing. We all started the game by picking a corner and building up on our own, it felt weird and I’m not sure how common that was, Birmingham itself didn’t get heavily developed until the very very end of the game. We ran out of iron cube components because people were building iron mines early and developing, I wondered to myself “How many people actually do this at the start of the game? Are we being weird? Did we run out of iron cubes because no one thought any group would do these terrible actions”. The tension through the game to go first was palpable. Every time the supply dropped you could see people planning and vibrating to be the first one to build an industry that filled it back up to get the auto flipped tile. Our supplies never dropped very much because everyone was ready to pounce. 

The card discard/hand mechanic that controls the entire game… is BRILLIANT. Listening to it in a video makes if feel finicky but once you’re actually playing the game you see the brilliance of its elegance. Being able to see clearly how many turns are left makes actions quantifiable and gives weight to every decisions. Setting your cards aside to use the weaker ones for canals/rails and trying to do the best with what you have gives a strong tactical element to the game. 

On the changes, I will say just about everything just “Made sense”. The scout action is better than the discarding 2 cards to use as any city. Being able to take loans until the end of the game just makes sense, also the game stops you from being dumb and only offers 30$ loans. The way Cotton/Manufacturer/Pottery is shipped seems to make so much more sense. I like the random placement of markets, it gives the game interesting twists when the pottery tiles are all on the very south. I love breweries, I think the third resource adds a lot. The only “Slight” disappointment I would have is that there is nothing quite like the “Shipyard” tiles where you spend a lot and just SLAM down VPs. I would have liked that. Pottery is close with the need to develop and huge victory points gains, but it still needs to be shipped to flip. Also Manufacturing and Cotton mills are just a bit too similar in game terms for my liking. They have small detail changes from tile to tile, but on a whole feel way too similar. I would have preferred a different mechanic to one of them. 

Our game ended with one person really far ahead and all 3 other players within a point of each other, 2 of them were tied. Despite criticism, this outcome was not foreseen at the end of the canal era, it was still anyone’s game. Even though the points were very far apart after the canal era there were so many swings in the railroad era that completely reshaped the VP track. I just wanted to sit back and talk about the mechanics for hours after. I made a push to get the resources for constant double rail actions near the end, loading connections around Birmingham. One player made a nice long line early in the game but it was through cities that no one developed really hurting that investment. I had a few early breweries up, and when everyone started really building breweries the market was then flooded, most of them weren’t flipped while all of mine were.

I just want to play the game again and again. Looking at the Lancashire rules I feel like there won’t be much reason to play it more than Birmingham. The minor tweaks smooth out some issues, and the way the Foreign Market/Harbor mechanics were changed is for the better I feel. This game is truly a masterpiece of design. I feel like we’ll be talking about it for the next 10 years.

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

​

OK HERE IS PROOF ITS AN A.I. ready? if you look at how the checkers game is exampled, you will see its like an algorithm, a chess engine works by use of an algorithm, everyone accepts its got an A.I.

​

ok I will try and design the checkers chits quickly so they may not be best done.

first chit decides to move one for normal pieces or one for crowned, im doing this fast so it will always take crowned, so flip to the crowned side of the chit. the crowned side is labelled forward,back,left,right

the second chit, overrides first chit if where is lands can be captured, forward,back,left,right

third chit, overrides first two chits if a multicapture is possible, take multicapture,take normal capture,take multicapture,take normal capture

forth chit, overrides third if where is lands can be captured, take multicapture if safe,take normal capture if safe ,take multicapture if safe ,take normal capture if safe.

these chits are quickly thought out, but I have just a jot of how it goes, and the labels are icons not labels. you may have a general rule to work from left hand pieces on the board to right hand side. checkers has the oddity here of overriding chits rather than combining like hand and sword

ts an algorithm that can be dynamically altered if the situation and outlook changes. you can alter it with one chit or more or all, and can change by them selves if a result alters the situation. Im sorry if Im unclear.

​

Not sure if this is really the best tread to post this on, but I saw another old api question here so I figured I'd give it a try. Feel free to redirect me if there is a better thread.

​

I'm currently trying to pull information on Boardgames from the BGG xml api. The flow is something like this:

User enters boardgame name as a search-&gt;

script polls the api for games matching that name and returns the results-&gt;

User picks the correct result-&gt;

script takes the boardgame ID from the picked result and polls the api again using the ID which gives all the needed info.

​

Here is the output I receive from the search:

    &lt;boardgames termsofuse=""[https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse](https://boardgamegeek.com/xmlapi/termsofuse)""&gt;
    		&lt;boardgame objectid=""238032""&gt;
    
    		&lt;name primary=""true""&gt;Betrayal at Baldur\&amp;#039;s Gate and House on the Hill Promo Cards&lt;/name&gt;			
    &lt;yearpublished&gt;2017&lt;/yearpublished&gt;
    &lt;/boardgame&gt;
    
    		&lt;boardgame objectid=""10547""&gt;
    
    		&lt;name primary=""true""&gt;Betrayal at House on the Hill&lt;/name&gt;

    &lt;yearpublished&gt;2016&lt;/yearpublished&gt;
    &lt;/boardgame&gt;
    
    &lt;/boardgames&gt;\

I can handle everything else from there. The issue I'm having, is that the boardgame's ID is wrapped up in an xml tag, and I can't figure out how to get the script to access that information. I can see the ID when I look at the output in the logs, but I can't figure out how to pull the ID into a variable. I have basically no xml experience which I'm sure is why I can't figure out something that seems fairly simple. I'm using google apps script on a google sheet (basically javascript). Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated!

&lt;p&gt;I can handle everything else from there. The issue I&amp;#39;m having, is that the boardgame&amp;#39;s ID is wrapped up in an xml tag, and I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to get the script to access that information. I can see the ID when I look at the output in the logs, but I can&amp;#39;t figure out how to pull the ID into a variable. I have basically no xml experience which I&amp;#39;m sure is why I can&amp;#39;t figure out something that seems fairly simple. I&amp;#39;m using google apps script on a google sheet (basically javascript). Any thoughts or suggestions would be much appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

​Our strategy involved kind of staying defensive of the few towns we got in the beginning, and slowly expanding out from there. However, after they whittled down our main attacking force in a battle where they got like 5 Fyrd reinforcements added to their army, they got two turns in a row and just swept completely through the remaining towns that had like 4 Norsemen in each one, and just to add insult to injury, converted the very last two men we had on the board for the win.

​​Now, I'm willing to consider, perhaps even assume, that we just suck at area control wargames, which isn't an issue.

​However, is staying defensive and holding onto the few towns you get in the beginning the wrong strategy? Should we be trying to shock them by spearing through the countryside and forcing them to leave other towns vulnerable by devoting men to stopping the spearhead, while we take advantage of that with new leaders and reinforcements that come at the beginning of each round?

Shut up and Sit Down are hands down my favourite, even when I don't agree they are so good at articulating what a game FEELS like and what they do or don't like about it that the review is always informative (and usually super entertaining to boot!)

I've always enjoyed Tom Vasel (and Miami Dice by extension), he was the first reviewer I got into and I've realised his tastes line up well with mine, so I can generally feel pretty confident in his recommendations. He generally conveys the rules well without getting bogged down in minutae... Useful when I want a better understanding of the nuts and bolts which SUSD don't usually convey in detail.

As for under serviced niche, personally I just found the Three Minute Review series, which I think is great.

For me, I tend to dislike:

**Lovecraft Mythos** themes, even though I like a few games which employ them (like Elder Sign, even though it's essentially Yatzeethulhu).

**Nerd culture/""gamer""** themes, full of geeky injokes or parodies (think Munchkin, Chez Geek etc).

**Star Wars**, or really most pop culture branded tie-ins. I'd rather they go the Twilight Imperium route and design their own IP drawing on archetypes from the genre. 

**Anime/Chibi-inspired visuals** (Arcadia Quest, Flash Duel) totally kill any interest I could have in a game. 

**8-bit/'retro'** video game-inspired games (Boss Monster et al). It's weird, because NES and SNES platformers are my favourite style of video games, but as a board game theme it just seems hokey.

&lt;p&gt;For me, I tend to dislike:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lovecraft Mythos&lt;/strong&gt; themes, even though I like a few games which employ them (like Elder Sign, even though it&amp;#39;s essentially Yatzeethulhu).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Nerd culture/&amp;quot;gamer&amp;quot;&lt;/strong&gt; themes, full of geeky injokes or parodies (think Munchkin, Chez Geek etc).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Star Wars&lt;/strong&gt;, or really most pop culture branded tie-ins. I&amp;#39;d rather they go the Twilight Imperium route and design their own IP drawing on archetypes from the genre. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Anime/Chibi-inspired visuals&lt;/strong&gt; (Arcadia Quest, Flash Duel) totally kill any interest I could have in a game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8-bit/&amp;#39;retro&amp;#39;&lt;/strong&gt; video game-inspired games (Boss Monster et al). It&amp;#39;s weird, because NES and SNES platformers are my favourite style of video games, but as a board game theme it just seems hokey. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How about everyone else? &lt;/p&gt;

Of course that normally means you just get to play more games and that's awesome, but it begs the question:

I think my top two are: 

**Deus**: The box art and theme are so boring that I would never have picked this game up unless my friend convinced me it was good. He told me ""After playing this game, you'll never need to play another engine builder again."" And my gods was he right.

From a [recent post](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/9aiz9c/boardgame_critics_need_to_be_more_critical/):

&gt;Like books, movies, and video games, I feel that board games are an art form. 

Great post. I agree with most of it, except for the idea that board games are an art form.

Board games *contain* art forms, but they're not art. They're games. (QED (jk)). They're more closely related to parlour games, which also contain artistic elements such as story-telling, acting.

I feel that that art is created to evoke a particular mood or engage with a certain philosophy or though process. While board games *can* do that, they're primarily created to entertain you.

And that's okay. It doesn't make them less valuable. They don't have to be art to be important. 

Games have intrinsic value. They're a cultural artifact wherein one of us put a lot of time and effort in entertaining the rest of us. 

Board games a form of play.

&gt;Play, you say? **Play!?!!?!** Only *chiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiildren* play!

Nah. I mean sure, historically this is true, but it was a pleasure we denied ourselves because of societal values, not an inevitable consequence of adulthood.

Play's important, and modern board games are a recognition of that. 

When we play, we create a shared and unique experience that's only made possible by the rules of the game. Someone provides the bottle, and we bring the lightning. It's socially engaging, it's humanizing, and it provokes thought.

Shortly put, play is healthy, whatever age you may be. 

Could we have our board games without art, be it visual or literary? No. But I don't think something *is* art just because it *contains* art.

There's no right answer here. I'm not art-shaming. 

Whether or not the definition of art should include the particularly high degree of interaction and variation that board games provide, I do think the definition of board games should embrace that it's a game - a form of play - and, as a rare and healthy expression of humanity, terribly important.

My friends and I have gotten into playing board games recently and it's a nice diversion to playing video game all the time or other stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

1. If you use the gadget card binoculars to peek under one of the tiles, and by doing that you know for certain the whereabouts of a ship part, can you place the part on the correct tile and go get it? Or do you need to flip over both artifact clue tiles before you can go to the right place to get it?

2. We only played a few games so far, but are we playing the water carrier right? He/she seems far and away the best character. So as long as you are adjacent to another player, you can exchange one of your water points for theirs, for the cost of one action. The carrier can also get two water out of a well even after it's been flipped later in the game, and receive two waters each action. I think this is correct, it just seems better then other characters. ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

Of course the gameplay won't be as rich, but it would be nice to play some of these games as a 'filler' or without having to reserve 2/3/4 hours or while waiting inbetween longer games.

For example perhaps doubling actions from all spots in viticulture may speed the game up and not affect too many dynamics other than increase the strength of blocking. 

Doubling resources gained or even just increasing the starting resources in terraforming mars would make the game play at a very fast rate (although some cards might be stronger than others)

Doubling the resources and halving the rounds in terra mystica would make the game play faster, but would definitely ruin the balance dynamics (R1 plays would be too strong wrt round bonus).

would love to hear any ideas if ya'll have tried this before :)

Of course the gameplay won&amp;#39;t be as rich, but it would be nice to play some of these games as a &amp;#39;filler&amp;#39; or without having to reserve 2/3/4 hours or while waiting inbetween longer games.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s great, easy to understand and everything looks polished in a way I think I can even get my not so board-gamy friends to play this just because of the theme.

Only thing that really bothers me is this cauldron. Like could they have made something that looks and feels any cheaper? I don’t think so. This thing is a disgrace in my opinion. 

The game is good enough that I’ll deal with it, but they should have done a better job in a licensed product. 

Am I the only one displeased about this? No review I read mentioned this. 

Is it maybe possible they deliver something better with an expansion?

I thought Descent would be a worthy follow-up, but its linearity and pure focus on complex combat put me off. It took two hours to set up the game, even with an experienced DM. And once the scenario started it was tiny with only one goal. 

In Hero Quest I had the ability to add extra flair to the game, with secret doors, monsters with personalities and extra rooms. I would even make my own treasure/weaponry cards. And the combat was so easy, any family member could join in. 

Is there any games out that has the same versatility?

And let's break it down, since I know so many people are looking for the same. 

What was awesome about Hero Quest?
This guy said it best.

* Awesome miniatures (and so simple/generic!)
* Awesome furniture, including THE DOORS!
* Fantastic, simple cards
* The beautiful board with procedural exploration (though I do love modular boards)
* The Quest Book - Lots of different scenarios, shown on just 2 pages each!
* The Box! Gosh do I love the art!
* GM Screen - My inspiration for all GameMasterings since! 
* Simple combat mechanics ( I don't mind more complex rules, but some overdo it)
* Expansions!


Here's my impression on current 'Hero Quest' successors stack up to that list!


**[Dungeon Saga](https://www.amazon.com/Mantic-Games-Dungeon-Saga-Dwarf/dp/B014IUO0NU#customerReviews)**
This REALLY looks awesome. Lots of expansions. Solid art style. Physical props. Simple treasure cards. Nice miniatures. Oooh, and are those door ways?! I like! 

But I have quality concerns. Sounds like the rulebook is a bit of a mess, games will show up damaged and it's a $100 investment to get it all. I don't mind putting in $120 and more for this game, but then it needs to be Hero Quest Quality with capital Q at least. :-)

**Gloomhaven**
Definitely a top contender, but I'm still trying to wrap my head around what the game actually is. Does it even have a GameMaster function? 

**Dungeons and Dragons Board Games**
Thanks for this suggestion! I didn't know you could combine these games. That's really interesting. But the maps I've seen so far were pretty uninspired and anything related to 4th edition is something I'm not sure about. Should I give it a go?

**Descent (2nd Ed)**
As mentioned above; I loved the look and feel of Descent , but for my purposes (getting my wife and beginners into RPG's) the game was too complex and felt too linear. The scenario starts and you must move from point A to point B, with no additional exploration or fun. 

In Hero Quest the GameMaster had the quiet choice of adding or removing a minion to make the game harder or easier for the players. Making such a decision in Descent didn't seem like an option as it'd leave a gaping hole in the plot. I only played 3 scenarios, so I could be wrong. 

**Massive Darkness**
Lots to like here, but it seems to lack the GM function and custom scenario parts I loved about Hero Quest. 

**[Warhammer Quest - Shadows of Hammerhal](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/218933/warhammer-quest-shadows-over-hammerhal)**
Giving this a look now. I might be able to overcome the Warhammer stigma if there's some flexibility in making your own maps here. Hmmm. 

**Mice &amp; Mystics**
Love the look, but from what I understand this is a very scenario, railroaded game. 


**Arcadia Quest**
If I can overcome the artstyle (it's well done, but not my cup of cute), I still don't like that there's only 9 map tiles in the game?


**Imperial Assault**
Love the game, but I have the same concerns as with Descent. Plus the setting isn't what I need. Gotta get me some sword and sorcery!

I was playing games over the weekend with some friends. I had just played for my turn and realized that another player could win next turn. I pointed this out to the table since I, and I assume the other players, do not want this to happen. This resulted in a conversation about Table Talk, and the one player was annoyed at my statement, and has been upset about pointing these kinds of things out in the past with other games.

Is it wrong to point out to someone what is happening? I try not to tell people what to do when it comes to these situations, but I do not have any problem pointing this out, especially on a board where the information is freely available.

The player feels that it is up to each player to pay attention themselves without it being pointed out to them. I feel that if a player is doing something I should be able to if I want to. There are times I may NOT want to tell someone what a player is doing, cause it will benefit me in some way. In the end, I want to win as that is the goal of the game. I would not ""assist"" a player unless it benefits me in some way. Someone else winning it me losing. It is just extremely annoying for me to have to hold back from pointing out someone winning the game.

&amp;#x200B;

TL:DR

&amp;#x200B;

Is pointing out to the group that someone could win the game next turn Table Talk? Is table talk wrong?

Edit: I wasn't going to mention the game, but I feel like it may be helpful or retract some statements. We we're playing Sequence, so not a lot of strategy involved.

I recently did some visualizations of the data on BGG and part of it was a *network visualization* of the board game categories to see what they are and how they relate to each other. I think it looks quite nice and therefore I decided to share it with you. I'll leave all the interpretation to you. First, a few short paragraphs of explanations. 

If you don't care about explanations and just want the images, here you go:
- [Network Visualization](https://imgur.com/igiBfcT)
- [Using Ratings and Weights](https://imgur.com/b109YKO)
- For more check out the ""More Stuff"" section at the bottom

## The Data

I did *not* use *all* of the data that BGG offers. I only included board games with at least 20 rating votes that have been released in 1990-2018 and excluded expansions. I collected the data in May 2018 where these constraints resulted in 15520 board games. Yes, you can download the data if you want to. The data is stored in a *SQLite* database that you can download [here](https://github.com/janbrrr/board-game-analysis/blob/master/data/database/data_2018-05-10.db). You can find a reference of the tables [here](https://github.com/janbrrr/board-game-analysis/blob/master/database_schema.png).

## What a Network Visualization is

As the name already suggests, a network visualization is a visualization of a *network*.  A network consists of *nodes* and *edges*.  In this case the nodes are the board game categories listed on BGG. An edge between two nodes indicates a *relationship* between both nodes. The *weight* of this edge indicates how strong this relationship is. What this exactly means is explained in the next part. After obtaining the nodes and edges, the next step is to apply a *layout algorithm* that takes the information about the edges and arranges/positions the nodes in a map such that the connections are respected. In other words, nodes connected by edges should end up spatially close, while unconnected nodes should end up far apart from each other. If the nodes are categories and an edge represents a relationship between two categories, categories that are related to each other should end up spatially close to each other.

The software I used to do this is called [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) and I used *Force Atlas 2* as layout algorithm. This algorithm applies forces that cause the nodes to ""repulse each other like charged particles, while edges attract their nodes, like springs"" [(paper)](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0098679#s2).

## Calculating the Edge Weights

The weight of an edge between two categories should be an indicator of how important both categories are for each other. The metric we will use is how often the two categories *co-occur* in board games. To be more precise, we calculate the co-occurrence in percent from the perspective of each of the two categories and add the results. This results in a maximum value of 200 if both categories only exist together.

It is much more obvious if you look at the formulas. Here is how to calculate an edge between two categories c0 and c1: [formula](https://imgur.com/ZKsE8fS)

This is not my idea, this approach is based on [Kriesel's work](http://www.dkriesel.com/blog/2016/1028_spiegelmining_think_big._die_artikellandschaft_der_letzten_zwei_jahre_zum_selberforschen) (it's in german).

## The Network Visualization

I suggest you to prepare some expectations of what categories you think go hand in hand. With that being said, I removed some very niche categories due to a lack of data.

[Click here](https://imgur.com/igiBfcT) to view the network visualization. Categories are sized according to the number of board games they appear in and colored according to detected communities. Big categories appear in more board games than small categories. Categories of the same color are assumed to belong to the same type of categories (i.e., they form a community).

## Adding Ratings and Complexity Ratings

We have two visual channels to display information: the node size and the color. Let's use them to display the *average rating* and the *average complexity rating*.

Now the categories are sized according to the average complexity of board games that feature this category. Small categories feature mostly simple games, while big categories mostly feature complex games.

The color of a category (a gradient from blue to red) will showcase the average rating of board games that feature this category. Blue categories feature lower rated board games, while red categories feature higher rated board games.

Again, I suggest to think of some expectations, that's more fun. [Here is the result](https://imgur.com/b109YKO).

In PotR you invest in various cities and try to help the ones you're invested in win wars and gain influence which in turn will make your investments worth more points in the end game. You start auctions for influence in a given city, buy troops to help you in wars, or start wars. 

It's a very unique system, and it's really fun to play the politics game without actually being a faction on the board. However, PotR is an older game with some rough edges. The main problems:

* A wildly unbalanced card deck, and you obtain cards through random draw.
* d6 combat system, so a simple die roll could end up with a +/-5 to your attack or defense value. This is made exponentially bad because combat is super rare, so the dice will not mitigate over time, nor are there many ways to mitigate them through abilities.
* Too few wars allowed per age and they get used fast. More wars would allow more interesting manipulation and intrigue.

I'd love to see a modern update from Wallace or someone else.

I’m a big fan of party-games, and this is a trend I cannot ignore. For me, it’s super important that party-games are portable, because I’ll be bringing them to parties (duh). And when the games are competing in my backpack for space with booze, clothing and other games, it pisses me off that so many of them waste space!

I get that a lot of boardgames leave space for expansions, but some still take it too far. Also, I’m confident that most don’t buy expansions, and the people that do probably won’t mind buying a bigger collector’s box.

First, how to do it right:

[Joking Hazard](https://i.imgur.com/ESVMrvZ.jpg)  
It’s small, compact and still has some room for expansions. And they sell bigger boxes specifically for the people that collect expansions!

In the grayarea:

[Funemployed](https://i.imgur.com/QuTTqRf.jpg)  
The box may be medium-sized, but is still more than twice as big as the cards included! I get it, “It’s for expansions!”. But seriously, twice as big? And regardless of expansions, what’s with the inch-wide border in the middle?

Worst offender:

[Snake Oil](https://i.imgur.com/qt0eGWT.jpg)  
Look at this. The box is huge! And all it contains are the cards on the left and one (perfectly foldable!) sheet with the rules! Not even “expansions!” is an excuse for this abonimation, especially considering the inside is [molded plastic](http://www.monopoliswonder.com/sites/default/files/Snake%20Oil3.jpg)! I can’t bring this box to parties! If I seriously have to buy a card-carrier box to bring your game places, then you’ve failed.

(A dishonorable mention that more may be familar with is [Spyfall](https://i.imgur.com/Zb7R2z9.jpg). What is with those borders?!)

I’m sure this problem is not exclusive to card-based party-games, but it is where it bothers me most considering it’s the one genre that needs to be portable. But let’s turn this into a discussion. Why do manufacturers do this?

Look at this. The box is huge! And all it contains are the cards on the left and one (perfectly foldable!) sheet with the rules! Not even “expansions!” is an excuse for this abonimation, especially considering the inside is &lt;a href=""http://www.monopoliswonder.com/sites/default/files/Snake%20Oil3.jpg""&gt;molded plastic&lt;/a&gt;! I can’t bring this box to parties! If I seriously have to buy a card-carrier box to bring your game places, then you’ve failed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this problem is not exclusive to card-based party-games, but it is where it bothers me most considering it’s the one genre that needs to be portable. But let’s turn this into a discussion. Why do manufacturers do this? And what are some other abuses of space you’ve witnessed?&lt;/p&gt;

My list is currently:

**Bayonets and Tomahawks**: Dare I say it a chit pushing wargame that looks...elegant? The topic is right up my alley, but the chit design, intuitive thought out custom dice (I'm a sucker for custom faced dice), the lack of CRT, the operational scale, the unique attrition system. I just want it to be 2019 to get this game. 

&amp;nbsp;

**The US Civil War**: I may end up pulling this if the p500 doesn't fill quickly, and just buy used on BGG. I want this game badly. The massive, mounted map is exactly what I love (looking at you Napoleons Triumph). I don't have a huge strategic wargame, and this one seems much more manageable then some of the other 3000 hours ones. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Andean Abyss**: The deeper questions and problems that Root works to address led me straight into the arms of COIN. Im interested in many of the games but have to start with one to see if I love it. The real guerilla nature of the factions in Andean Abyss vs the government really appeal to me, as does the Columbian cartel theme. Lucky for me September kicks off COINCfest, so perfect timing. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Imperial Struggle** I've enjoyed the Twilight Struggle app but the Cold War is an incredibly bland theme to me. 18th century Twilight Struggle? I'm on board. This p500 has been up for 2 years but hopefully we see a print mid 2019 as they've posted. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Nevsky**: Volko Ruhnke is my hero. This new system of feudal obligation, the difficulty of running a medieval campaign during a feudal season, the operational scale involving logistics and supply. I am very excited for this game, and have been following interviews closely in it's development. I have a feel this will be a new groundbreaking engine. Volko says he's hoping to do England vs Longshanks for the next game, and I know I'll be a day one backer if this system pans out. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Versailles 1919**: A highly thematic and historical negotiation, bidding, political game that work 4p, 2p, AND solo? This is going to sit very happily next to John Company in my weird, cool, history game shelf. 

&amp;nbsp;

**Flying Colors**: This will be the first hex and counter in my collection. I am a huge 18th century naval warfare buff, so this has a huge appeal to me. I own Sail of Glory and while I enjoy it, the fleet actions and scale of Flying Colors will play much better I think. Very close to hitting 500 so hopefully a reprint soon.

&amp;nbsp;

**The Last Hundred Yards**: Above all the games on the list, this feels the most groundbreaking. A fast playing hex and counter, the reaction and initiative mechanic seems incredible. A game without simultaneous action selection that creates a feeling of simultaneous control. The fact that units only react instead of act when not using initiative means that flanking is a very viable play, and the system of dissaray means a counterattack is a reaction with serious punch. I am very very excited for this one.

4. First game starts, and they do ask questions. However, each of them asks questions for almost everything they see (i.e. for each card effect), and then spends some more time deciding what to do. This process takes a lot of time.
5. If I tell them to hurry up, as I make all my moves in a few seconds, they get annoyed saying I have already known all the rules so I should be patient.
6. As the game goes on, they gradually ""understand"" the game, but still make arbitrary moves because they are are not familiar with the game enough.

8. Besides a few gamer friends, most complain ""Let's play something else now since this game takes too long"" and they will spread the incorrect view of these games being ""extremely lengthy"" to other friends.

They tell stories and communicate ideas and emotions. In order to take them seriously as art I feel that board game critics could do with being a little more... critical. When I am watching The Dice Tower, Rahdo or, worst of all, Man vs Meeple, I get the feeling that despite talking about other aspects of the game like component quality, length of play, theme, etc, the reviews often boil down to ""did I have fun playing this game"".

""What's wrong with that?"" I hear you ask. After all, isn't fun the most important thing? And, it is, but here's the kicker... **you can have fun playing a bad game!** Anyone who has enjoyed the deeply flawed monopoly as a kid should know this. Enjoying a bad game doesn't make you bad, or stupid, or wrong, and there are plenty of reasons why you might enjoy a bad game. Maybe it just scratches a certain itch that makes you overlook its flaws. Cool, You do you! However, when it comes to professional critics I expect some deeper evaluation. If I want player reviews, I'll go to BGG.

Just compare the difference between movie reviews and board game reviews. Audiences tend to focus on the raw emotional ""did I enjoy this"", while critics will examine pacing, character development, themes (I don't just mean genre, I mean what is the movie ""saying"") and cinematography. This is why Rotten Tomatoes has separate audience and critic reviews.  I personally loved the first Resident Evil movie, despite it being destroyed by critics, and The Transformers movie has 85% positive reviews from audience members, but only 57% positive reviews from critics.

Art is subjective and we like what we like, but there is often a theory behind art that provides a basis for critical evaluation e.g. in music theory we can talk about ""colour"" or ""tension"". This is why critics of other mediums often come to similar conclusions e.g. The Lord Of The Rings is good, 50 Shades Of Grey is bad (despite 50 shades of grey having a massive following). Meanwhile, amongst board game critics you tend to get wildly different evaluations of the same game with no consistency of theory. This is becoming more and more important with the share number of board games being produced these days. It's not helpful when 80% of reviews end in ""has some issues, but I still had fun with it"".","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like books, movies, and video games, I feel that board games are an art form.

The problem with bullshit simulators is that because everything is random, you can never actually strategize in advance.

I've been very curious about Dominare and been wanting to play it for a long time. I've hesitated on purchasing it because I wasn't sure how my group would like it, but I think now that they probably would like it after all. At least it's worth a shot I think.

  
Anyway, AEG doesn't even have the Tempest games on their website anymore. Anyone know if they've stopped any kind of support for the game and that it won't see any new reprints? Amazon UK wants 120 pounds for a game but there's a place in Sweden were I could snag it for the normal price. But I want to hold off for a while so hence my question to you.

One, when the app says target a hero or attack a hero can familiars be the target of that attack?

Also, we played on hard difficulty and it didn’t say whether to put level one or level two monster groups out does anyone know what you default to if it doesn’t explicitly say what level?

I know from imperial assault if you are adjacent to a friendly you have line of sight to an enemy beyond, as if you were shooting around your friend. Does the same rule applies in the sent?

I wanted to get feedback from someone who had preordered a game from this site and may of had the same issue as me or could clarify something since it’s my first time doing a preorder. 


I placed an order a couple days ago for 5 games, 4 of items being a preorder for Fireball Island and it’s 3 expansions. I have already been charged the correct amount of all 5 games and they all show on my invoice. However, when I access my order on their webpage and look at the invoice, underneath the main game (Fireball island, the curse of Vul-Kar) it says: “This product cannot be reordered because it's out of stock.” Then at the bottom of the invoice there’s an action button that says ‘reorder,’ which I have not clicked. Now, if you access the main game on their site it now shows OOS. 


I would just like to know if my order has went through or not. Seeing the message confuses me, but I don’t know if it just shows the message because they are now OOS or that I won’t be getting the preorder? I’ve already tried calling their facility but it goes to voicemail and I’m unable to leave a message. I’ve also emailed but have not heard a response. 

If anyone had any info or help with this I would appreciate it. Thank you in advance.

 This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

 All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

 Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;h2&gt;What this is:&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;

2. It's frustrating. Take that and people interfering with your strategy will be a constant thorn in your side. If you prefer more solitaire euro-style games, this isn't for you.

3. It's not for young children. The cards require too much reading and interaction between other cards to allow small children to play well. If you're thinking you can play this with your 6 or 4 year old, you're mistaken.

4. It's not for non-Disney fans. There are other games that do what Villainous does better like Scythe. But if you're a Disney fan who enjoys medium-light strategy games, you'll really dig this.

5. It will rely heavily on expansions to stay fresh. After playing villains a few times each, you may get bored and want to move on to other villains.

6. Each villain is fun enough that you'll want to try them a few times. They all feel similar and different enough that they make the game very enjoyable each time.

7. The components are great and the game is worth the price. The cards are nice and thick, the player boards are well designed. The pieces are heavy plastic, and the tokens are well finished.

8. You'll want more expansions because the 6 villains are so much fun. You can even [go online and vote](http://www.wonderforge.com/games/disney/villainous/voting.php) for them and the list to vote for is huuuuuuge.

9. The game relies on players to balance each other out. There is not built in mechanic to do that. If two players start to develop a vendetta, there could be one or two who run away with the win.

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you.

Conflict, negotiation, dice throwing and other randomness typify American games as well as an emphasis on aesthetics and design decisions like miniatures.

My favorite American board games include:

* **Twilight Imperium Fourth Edition** - an obvious choice, I know (but don't worry if you have different reasons), this day long, table hog space opera epic combines depth and complexity to provide a feeling of grand, meaningful choices and challenge with incredibly intuitive and streamlined gameplay to make it so fun and rewarding and deceptively accessible.

Big and scary and beautiful, yet so refined; Twilight Imperium refuses to bog down in when it really should. This game of unwieldy proportions, this game which looks as though it's supposed to be - that looks like it should be an experience filled with deep, isolating, unsocial, calculated thought set to the sound of yawns of everyone else around the table defies all that.  As a first time player make their first moves, they realize this game isn't a heavy, exhausting boulder pressing down on their shoulders but a well weighted dumbbell that's a delight to lift.  Players realize their turns aren't as tough as they though, that there is an atmosphere providing room to talk... room to negotiate!... room to laugh and yell and gasp!  Of course deep planning is still made, there are tense and quiet and even slow moments but it's all executed so well.  The opposite of multiplayer solitaire, possibly my favorite aspect of Twilight Imperium is that no matter what is happening, everyone is still kept invested in the board.  Intrigued to find out what the other players might do.  This is a game where even when it isn't your turn, it still feels like you're having a go - even when strategic actions aren't being played.  Twilight Imperium is a heavy game that's light, a thinking game that manages to get everyone talking, a long game that feels so quick because it's always so interesting and fun!  A true masterpiece.

* **Cosmic Encounter** - *another* obvious choice.  It is light, quirky, engaging and screams replay-ability.

This is a game, that like Twilight Imperium, refuses to let players around the table become bored.  All of the variable powers set ontop of a simple yet deep fighting and alliance-brokering foundation really make this game special.  I'd argue this is the closest thing to TI4-lite because it captures that very same atmosphere which gets players engaged and talking and yelling and laughing!

[EDIT]

Thanks for all the responses.  I think we did play a few things incorrectly.  It's possible that the horns stat was not properly respected after a while (we did try to keep an eye on this...though we might have let it slide as it got late and we got tired).

I think the main problem for us was that we incorrectly did NOT end the action phase after all territories had been pillaged.  We kept playing until everyone was out of rage, meaning that people could move into a territory quickly and pillage it uncontested without any penalty, and we were just left trying to burn through our remaining rage when the phase already should have ended and the threat of battle had already subsided due to early pillaging.  I think playing this rule correctly will have a really big impact on our future plays.

FWIW, we did play the Invade and March actions correctly, and I still wonder whether the March action might be a little too powerful because if you have minis remaining from the previous age at the beginning of a new age and the other players have been largely wiped out, you can easily March to entirely occupy a territory with no potential from retaliation from your opponents.  I wonder whether limiting the March action to 2 models might be a little more balanced because it would make it impossible to fill all the village spots in a territory as a result of one action, and would give every player a chance to respond to your movement before you can pillage.  Of course I also acknowledge that I have only played this game twice and I probably don't know what I am talking about yet :P.

A final thought, which others have mentioned, is that while turtling into a specific territory for quests might be still be possible, it's very unlikely to be a winning strategy.  I arguably used this strategy more than anyone in our games (to turtle and multi-pillage Ygdrassil, no less), and I still lost because other players were able to dominate strength quests and Valhalla points elsewhere.

Thanks for the feedback!  Definitely clarified some things for me.

[EDIT X2]

Played the game twice again today.  Admittedly it was 2 players this time versus 3 last night, so that might affect the experience as well, but with these corrected rules the game played really well.  After my initial experience I was considering selling the game, but after today I can safely say it's a prized item in my collection.

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for all the responses.  I think we did play a few things incorrectly.  It&amp;#39;s possible that the horns stat was not properly respected after a while (we did try to keep an eye on this...though we might have let it slide as it got late and we got tired).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the main problem for us was that we incorrectly did NOT end the action phase after all territories had been pillaged.  We kept playing until everyone was out of rage, meaning that people could move into a territory quickly and pillage it uncontested without any penalty, and we were just left trying to burn through our remaining rage when the phase already should have ended and the threat of battle had already subsided due to early pillaging.  I think playing this rule correctly will have a really big impact on our future plays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FWIW, we did play the Invade and March actions correctly, and I still wonder whether the March action might be a little too powerful because if you have minis remaining from the previous age at the beginning of a new age and the other players have been largely wiped out, you can easily March to entirely occupy a territory with no potential from retaliation from your opponents.  I wonder whether limiting the March action to 2 models might be a little more balanced because it would make it impossible to fill all the village spots in a territory as a result of one action, and would give every player a chance to respond to your movement before you can pillage.  Of course I also acknowledge that I have only played this game twice and I probably don&amp;#39;t know what I am talking about yet :P.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A final thought, which others have mentioned, is that while turtling into a specific territory for quests might be still be possible, it&amp;#39;s very unlikely to be a winning strategy.  I arguably used this strategy more than anyone in our games (to turtle and multi-pillage Ygdrassil, no less), and I still lost because other players were able to dominate strength quests and Valhalla points elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for the feedback!  Definitely clarified some things for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[EDIT X2]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Played the game twice again today.  Admittedly it was 2 players this time versus 3 last night, so that might affect the experience as well, but with these corrected rules the game played really well.  After my initial experience I was considering selling the game, but after today I can safely say it&amp;#39;s a prized item in my collection.  Great game!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm happy to announce that I'm going to self-publish my first board game, entitled CardsLab Countries:

[https://imgur.com/a/58EbZWd](https://imgur.com/a/58EbZWd)

The game will be published first in Portuguese and in English later on.

It's an educational board game and it's the first one of a series of themes that will be launched in the next years. The first one as you can see is about Geography :)

It has simple mechanic. It's a turn based game, each of them composed by 5 phases, where the players can complete missions with their cards in hand, obtain points and earn special cards that change the course of the game, and challenge other players with questions from his cards or battle against all the players in the table, by choosing the best country features. The player who reaches a certain number of points or eliminates all the opponents wins the game.

The game is being developed and tested since 2016, when our company won an award on a Gamification Event held in Portugal (Novabase Gameshifters 2016).

Feel free to comment or give any advice or suggestions.

It is not everyday when someone posts about news from Polish board game scene. This week, however, quite a shocking news were unveiled and I think it's worth passing the info to the rest of the world.

As you may or may not know, [Marcin ""Senior"" Ropka](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/84236/marcin-senior-ropka), author of [Alien Artifacts](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181293/alien-artifacts) and [Take a Train](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182799/take-train), and a designer of an upcoming game [Solar City](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/248182/solar-city), was working for a Polish game publisher [Games Factory](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/35960/games-factory), has announced yesterday that he'll be leaving Games Factory.

This would have been just a normal decision - we all change our jobs from time to time - if it wasn't for the reason. On Wednesday, Polish board gaming world went through quite a shock after it was revealed that Games Factory was lying about the delays for the crowdfunded Polish edition of expansions for [Raiders of the North Sea](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170042/raiders-north-sea).

For months, backers were told by the publisher that the expansions are printed and only held by Custom Office. GF even posted e-mail screenshots from Custom Agency that were supposed to be a proof of them trying to deal with the situation (you can see them [here](https://staticwspieram.pl/ckfinder/userfiles/30944/0fc11aa3bf1c81dfbafb1883e7860c31-58b60601da02672350c9a88915c7af12.jpg), but they're in Polish).

Only recently, one of the backers asked RotN designer, [Shem Philips](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/12547/shem-phillips), if he was aware of the situation. And the response started the crisis: [https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu\_Z41zTytI/W33jpz3cSSI/AAAAAAAANbk/LPRz4ra6RhQzjiJF23dF2naGIa5CZEALwCLcBGAs/s1600/Kryzys.jpg](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Yu_Z41zTytI/W33jpz3cSSI/AAAAAAAANbk/LPRz4ra6RhQzjiJF23dF2naGIa5CZEALwCLcBGAs/s1600/Kryzys.jpg)

It was a shock for everyone to learn that GF was actually lying about Custom Office delays, but instead haven't paid for the print that happened 8 MONTHS AGO.

Obviously, everyone wanted a comment from GF, who finally released a statement saying they're sorry that they've lied about it, that what Shem said was truth and that they've tried behind the scenes to fix the situation and find some external sources to fund the print (despite [a successful crowdfunding campaign on Wspieram.to](https://wspieram.to/najezdzcydodatki), where they've collected 62 907 PLN for them (\~ 17 000 USD)). They've promised they'll return the money to backers, although people are being very cautious about that promise.

This isn't the end of it, however. Games Factory hasn't only run the campaign for RotN expansions in Polish, but has also a few other finished campaigns that haven't been delivered to backers. On 14 June 2016, they've successfully ran [a cf to fund Polish edition of Mage Wars: Arena and MW: Academy](https://wspieram.to/magewars), with the result of 68 156 PLN (\~ 18 450 USD). Backers were promised they'll get their MW products in November 2016, but they had to wait until June 2018 to get Mage Wars: Academy. MW: Arena hasn't still be delivered, but backers are being told that the shipment to them should start after mid-October 2018. Some are still hopeful, others aren't.

But that's still not all of it! They also have undelivered Valeria: Card Kingdoms Polish edition (with an original promise of delivery in March 2018) and Board Game Creative Kit (January 2018), which was also cf [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689336268/board-game-creative-kit).

Only recently the campaign to fund Solar City was finished [on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1689336268/solar-city-a-solarpunk-game). The publisher has said they've secured funding for the print, so it shouldn't be affected by the recent revelations, but, once again, it has to be taken in with a grain of salt.

I'm sure many of you seen similar things happening on Kickstarter before, but for us in Poland, that's the first case where a company has done such a dodgy move. The uproar caused by this in our country is huge (well, at least among board gamers) and it might have some consequences to how people view crowdfunding board games, which is very sad. A lot of commenters have suggested backers to look to withdraw their pledges for the undelivered campaigns where possible.

Personally, I hope that this whole thing will not affect Solar City delivery and that the duo of Marcin Ropka and Viola Kijowska (designers of Solar City) will continue releasing new games through a much more reputable publisher in the future.

P.S.2. For those who understand Polish, there's also a great summary article available [here](http://www.planszowkiwedwoje.pl/2018/08/games-factory-kamstwa-i-crowdfunding.html) with responses from the involved parties.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is not everyday when someone posts about news from Polish board game scene. This week, however, quite a shocking news were unveiled and I think it&amp;#39;s worth passing the info to the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know, &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamedesigner/84236/marcin-senior-ropka""&gt;Marcin &amp;quot;Senior&amp;quot; Ropka&lt;/a&gt;, author of &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/181293/alien-artifacts""&gt;Alien Artifacts&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182799/take-train""&gt;Take a Train&lt;/a&gt;, and a designer of an upcoming game &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/248182/solar-city""&gt;Solar City&lt;/a&gt;, was working for a Polish game publisher &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamepublisher/35960/games-factory""&gt;Games Factory&lt;/a&gt;, has announced yesterday that he&amp;#39;ll be leaving Games Factory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would have been just a normal decision - we all change our jobs from time to time - if it wasn&amp;#39;t for the reason. On Wednesday, Polish board gaming world went through quite a shock after it was revealed that Games Factory was lying about the delays for the crowdfunded Polish edition of expansions for &lt;a href=""https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/170042/raiders-north-sea""&gt;Raiders of the North Sea&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Features: 

- All basic and advanced cards from the Space Alert base game. 

- Automatic processing of all player actions, threats damage, and threat actions. 

- Randomizes and appropriately applies damage tiles.

- Turn by turn text based readout of your game results. 

- End game scoring provided.

Note: Ginkgopolis was Game of the Week on /r/boardgames [two years ago today](/4zcpbz). This GoTW repost gives people of the sub a chance to discuss the game again after a bit of time has passed. Do you still play it? If so, how often does it make it to the table? Has the game held up after repeated plays? Has it moved up or down in your personal ranking? Has it been replaced by a newer, similar game? Has it replaced a game?

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

2212: Ginkgo Biloba, the oldest and strongest tree in the world, has become the symbol of a new method for building cities in symbiosis with nature. Humans have exhausted the resources that the Earth offered them, and humanity must now develop cities that maintain a delicate balance between resource production and consumption. Habitable space is scarce, however, and mankind must now face the challenge of building ever upwards. To develop this new type of city, you will gather a team of experts around you, and try to become the best urban planner for Ginkgopolis.

In  Ginkgopolis, the city tiles come in three colors: yellow, which provides victory points; red, which provides resources; and blue, which provides new city tiles. Some tiles start in play, and they're surrounded by letter markers that show where new tiles can be placed.

On a turn, each player chooses a card from his hand simultaneously. Players reveal these cards, adding new tiles to the border of the city in the appropriate location or placing tiles on top of existing tiles. Each card in your hand that you don't play is passed on to your left-hand neighbor, so keep in mind how your play might set up theirs!

When you add a new tile to the city, you take a ""power"" card of the same color, and these cards provide you additional abilities during the game, allowing you to scale up your building and point-scoring efforts.

This GoTW repost gives people of the sub a chance to discuss the game again after a bit of time has passed. Do you still play it? If so, how often does it make it to the table? Has the game held up after repeated plays? Has it moved up or down in your personal ranking? Has it been replaced by a newer, similar game? Has it replaced a game?&lt;/p&gt;

There are only 3 players (me and the other 2 players - let's say A and B). We all love playing boardgames and meet regularly.

​

The issue is I and A's boardgame skills are quite on the same level while B's is lower. Usually I and A play well (the VP gap is so close throughout the game) while B's VP is much lower. When the game is about to end and it's B turn, he usually decides the outcome of the game. I mean his move always affects who will be the winner, I or A.

​

For example: In Viticulture with Tuscany, B's last move (his best move at that moment) was to sell a wine token with bonus (placing a star). I and A had 26 VP and we both contolled provinces equally. IIRC the star placed by B on any province would make either I or A lost the game so it was like a coinflip situation who B wanted to win.

Another example: In Brass Birmingham, in rail era B's VP was 20-ish while I and A's was at 60-ish. B knew that I was going to build Pottery tile level 4 (guarantee 20 VPs), so he decided to build Pottery tile level 2 (guarantee 1 VP) to block me (because I was the leader) instead of building something else that gave more VPs. This move totally boosted the chance that A won.

​

Any suggestion to prevent this kind of situation, where you could lose a game because of the losing player?

(Sorry about the grammar as English is not my native language)

While each batch of students know each other pretty well, inter-year interaction is minimal and I'd like to improve that by starting a weekly boardgame night to give people a platform to meet people from other years. There are a core group of friends (4-6 people) that would be able to attend every week, so even if only a handful of people turn up we could start a game or two. Between us, we have a game collection of around 40-50 games. We'd be expecting about 20 people each week, although attendance would likely vary greatly each week due to work load and depending on whether or not people invite friends.

&amp;#x200B;

The biggest question I have now would be how to best structure the session. It's planned to be a very relaxed and social event, where the focus is not on the games but on meeting people, especially because we can't expect everyone to be boardgame enthusiasts. We don't want to have such a rigid structure that it discourages people from attending, but also don't want it to be without a plan entirely such that newcomers feel isolated for example. Should we intentionally break people up and form groups for them, or let them choose for themselves? Do we wait for most people to turn up, or start playing as and when people arrive? Should we start with party games or just let each group decide what they want to play? Originally I was thinking since its a weekly event, we could feature a game every week and talk about it for like 5-10 minutes at the start to introduce it to more people, but then thought that this was a bit much for a casual event such as this. Thoughts?

&amp;#x200B;

I also have questions regarding the first session specifically. For the first session, we were planning on holding a more formal introduction of how the event would work and ground rules. I have some rules in mind (No drinks/using phones at the tables, respect each other and the games), but are there any other important rules or reminders I should set at the start? Should we break out our entire collection to get people interested or just bring a couple every week and change it up each week? Nametags?

It's my least favorite mechanic in all games aside from sand timer WP games. Shudder.

Still, I kinda like action selection games (Kemet, Scythe). So I thought, ""what's the difference?"" Aren't they kinda the same thing? There's plenty of WP games where you can fight or block or get better actions by waiting; it's a wide-open canvas. So why do I universally despise the mechanic in every game I play with it featured?

Searching through the different games I've played, I think I came up with the reason why this is and it might seem obvious to many.

In WP games. the action selection happens on the main board, making it into a large action selection mat, preventing meaningful consequences from occurring and hiding the true choices of a players decision away from the group, leading to the dreaded solitaire game of which I loathe. This is the opposite of what it should be.

The main board must always be where the story of the game is transpiring. The effect of the action is always public and does not need to be explained to the other players. Depending on the game, this does not have to be aggressive or confrontational to the other player. The choice of the player is not what is important. The consequence is. The effect of a choice must be demonstrated to the group so as to best show a story developing and that choice and decisions are notably affecting the game flow.

This is more common in action selection games, whereas the player board/ decision space (or cards or other selection options) happens individually, while the outcome of their decision happens on the board in front of the group showing action and consequences are occurring. Whether this is the technical difference I don't know, but I found it to be true time and time again in the games I prefer.

What're your thoughts on this ever popular modern mechanic that just seems to stick around year after year?

The kind that over-analyses everything, AP-prone, stalls the game until he finds the best outcome, winning at all costs even to the detriment of fun.

My brother-in-law plays with my wife and I regularly. We're slowly expanding the group and introducing other family and friends that are interested in playing board games. One of his friends (lets call him J for ease) recently found out about our game days and asked to be included. I noticed that he exhibits both analysis paralysis and a competitive streak.

While we don't insist that people play nice, J literally stalls games until he finds the optimal move. He'll go around the table asking of past moves in area control games. In a social deduction game J has asked us to re-announce moves / decisions in order to analyse reactions and expressions - not once - but repeatedly. In game with combination effects, he started breaking down every possible effect and interaction every single turn. J even starts counting cards in a card game. A single game of Cockroach Poker took 90 minutes to finish.

I'm not adverse to having different players at the table, some will be naturally better at some games, some will naturally grok games... but dealing with someone who plays to win, even if it means spoiling the fun of the day... I'm getting tired of this.

Sure I'm all about good sportsmanship, but if I wanted that environment, I'd play MtG competitively again. I  like to have varied players, but not one that spoils the fun just to win.

How have you guys dealt with this?

&amp;#x200B;

Dogfight Squadron is a WW2 or WW1 dogfighting simple game with an ordinary deck of cards, its a two player game but can also be a Solataire game(See optional Rules at the bottom for Solo play)  

&amp;#x200B;

you can have one or more planes in your squadron, your opponant can also have one or more planes, four is the recomended maximum squadron size.

&amp;#x200B;

use two decks of playing cards , one for the plane manouvers and one for cutting for hits.

&amp;#x200B;

each suit in a deck represent a manouver heart = Climb, Dimonds = Dive Clubs = Peel Left Spades = Peel Right

&amp;#x200B;

each plane can be in three states unoposed, tailing or being tailed, use a coin to represent this heads means tailing ,tails means being tailed, no coin unoposed(free).

&amp;#x200B;

two cards are chosen for each plane in your squadron and placed face down in front of you, your opponant chooses two of his cards per plane and places them opposing each of your planes, the position of the cards is important they have to oppose one plane by one plane. if you or your opponant have more planes then you dont oppose a plane but the plane is free to attack any plane. once the cards are chosen they cant be changed.

&amp;#x200B;

THE COMBAT BEGINS

&amp;#x200B;

1) now choose one of your planes that is being tailed and flip one card to show its manouver,heart = Climb, Dimonds = Dive Clubs = Peel Left Spades = Peel Right.

&amp;#x200B;

2) now the opponant flips a card of the plane oppsing you that is tailing, or he may activate a plane that has no opposing plane(free planes are not tailing or being tailed). the new free activated plane can continue the dogfight in effect gets two choices of planes to tail you.

&amp;#x200B;

if the cards are differrent manouvers( differrent suits) then your plane is no longer being tailed, instead your plane is now tailing the plane opposing you. 

&amp;#x200B;

if your cards are the same repeat with the second cards in the same way as before. if the cards are differrent manouvers( differrent suits) then your plane is no longer being tailed, instead your plane is now tailing the plane opposing you.

&amp;#x200B;

if your opponant matched both cards it gets a shot at you, this is a high-low (but not picture cards and Ace's) cut if the opponant draws higher than you your plane is shot down, if the opponant gets the same or lower he missed, if a player draws an Picture the other plane is shot down, if both draw a Picture both are shot down. If a player draws an Ace a new plane joins your squadron next turn. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) now do it all again for any other planes being tailed, when you have done all your planes the opponant does the same for planes that he has being tailed. 

&amp;#x200B;

keep repeating untill one side has won air-superiority by destroying all oposing aircraft.

&amp;#x200B;

WIN OR LOSE

&amp;#x200B;

you win by having the last plane flying, or a pre-determined situation

&amp;#x200B;

OPTIONAL RULES

&amp;#x200B;

bombers have 3 cards but only two are played, but they can not tail a fighter, they can only be tail an enemy bomber, only unaposed fighters or bombers can tail a bomber.

&amp;#x200B;

you can have larger scale battles with fighters and bombers, if your bombers survive the dogfight, each surviving bomber gets to drop bombs on a land target, its a simple high-low (but not picture cards and Ace's) cut if the draw is higher then the bomber destroys target, if the same or lower its missed. the land targets are represented with Js(worth 1 point), Qs(worth 2 point), &amp; Ks(worth 3 point) 

&amp;#x200B;

Solitaire play can easily be possible , dont look and deal plane cards face down the side your playing against, now select your cards as normal, then reveal the unoposed cards of the oposing planes - this is so you can play them if its possible. now play as normal but on the oposing squadron only reveal the plane cards as you play , flip one card at a time for that plane, use an un-oposed planes cards if they would carry-on the tail, instead of the face down card. I would suggest giving the oposing squadron an unoposed plane extra than you.

 

CAMPAIGN GAME 

&amp;#x200B;

the campaign use a airforce for each side, you can decide what planes are in it by spending 25 points for each side. bombers cost 3 points , fighters cost 1 point. select 5 Js 3 Qs and 2 Ks as ground targets.

&amp;#x200B;

each player assigns enemy ground targets placed behind the enimy planes, you can assign upto 4 targets, BUT if you fail to destroy all targets you get a penalty of - 5 points at the end of the campaign if no one won the war.

&amp;#x200B;

you can send upto as many planes as you have left in your airforce, you dont need to send all, place them infront of you and select there cards. if your enemy have more planes flying they will be able to tail you more easily.

&amp;#x200B;

resolve each wave of planes as usual, but bombers are the only planes that can destroy land targets. if you destroy all Ground targets first you win the war. if no-one destroys all ground targets after one side has won total-air-superiority count up the targets destroyed Js for 1 point each, Qs for 2 points, Ks for 3 points

&amp;#x200B;

NOTES

&amp;#x200B;

the free unoposed planes can play a card against any plane instead of the oposed plane.

&amp;#x200B;

in the campaign you can change the point to fit your war if you wish","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dogfight Squadron v5 by Mark Ainsworth&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dogfight Squadron is a WW2 or WW1 dogfighting simple game with an ordinary deck of cards, its a two player game but can also be a Solataire game(See optional Rules at the bottom for Solo play)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you can have one or more planes in your squadron, your opponant can also have one or more planes, four is the recomended maximum squadron size.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;use two decks of playing cards , one for the plane manouvers and one for cutting for hits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;each suit in a deck represent a manouver heart = Climb, Dimonds = Dive Clubs = Peel Left Spades = Peel Right&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;each plane can be in three states unoposed, tailing or being tailed, use a coin to represent this heads means tailing ,tails means being tailed, no coin unoposed(free).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;two cards are chosen for each plane in your squadron and placed face down in front of you, your opponant chooses two of his cards per plane and places them opposing each of your planes, the position of the cards is important they have to oppose one plane by one plane. if you or your opponant have more planes then you dont oppose a plane but the plane is free to attack any plane. once the cards are chosen they cant be changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE COMBAT BEGINS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) now choose one of your planes that is being tailed and flip one card to show its manouver,heart = Climb, Dimonds = Dive Clubs = Peel Left Spades = Peel Right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) now the opponant flips a card of the plane oppsing you that is tailing, or he may activate a plane that has no opposing plane(free planes are not tailing or being tailed). the new free activated plane can continue the dogfight in effect gets two choices of planes to tail you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if the cards are differrent manouvers( differrent suits) then your plane is no longer being tailed, instead your plane is now tailing the plane opposing you. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if your cards are the same repeat with the second cards in the same way as before. if the cards are differrent manouvers( differrent suits) then your plane is no longer being tailed, instead your plane is now tailing the plane opposing you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;if your opponant matched both cards it gets a shot at you, this is a high-low (but not picture cards and Ace&amp;#39;s) cut if the opponant draws higher than you your plane is shot down, if the opponant gets the same or lower he missed, if a player draws an Picture the other plane is shot down, if both draw a Picture both are shot down. If a player draws an Ace a new plane joins your squadron next turn. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) now do it all again for any other planes being tailed, when you have done all your planes the opponant does the same for planes that he has being tailed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;keep repeating untill one side has won air-superiority by destroying all oposing aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

In comes Mage Knight.

I read about it by chance when discovering Boardgamegeek by the recommendation of a friend, and I was awe-struck. A complex strategy game, in its puzzles not unlike MtG, that you could play by yourself? So I became a solo board gamer. 

But not for long. When I told everyone I knew about this crazy thing of solo gaming, I found out that a lot of my acquaintances from the more casual circles of Magic were playing board games, too (and alienated a lot of the non-nerds). So I got sucked into that.

In a few weeks my view on analog gaming completely changed. Suddenly I was playing multiple times a week, and I loved every minute of it. 

I started collecting games, furiously, sometimes buying multiple games at once, multiple times a month. I'm sure most of you know this quite well. "" Aquisition phase"", as they call it.

But something started to change. I bought more and more hardcore games, since that was the natural progression as I thought. 
And as far as I moved up on the complexity scale on BGG, my passion for the hobby started to fade.

I decided to change something. So I tried something radically different. Instead of playing Rosenberg's and Lacerda's, I played Jenga and Junk art. And I was completely baffled. These games that I frowned upon for so long for being ""beginner's games"" or ""child's play"", I enjoyed so much more. I started to look up from boards and into the broad smiles of my fellow gamers.

I still play a lot of strategy games. But I began to love the simple, social side of gaming a lot more. And I always look forward to the end of gaming events, for then we play what's called the "" silly games"".

I love this hobby, more than ever. Thanks for reading this :-)

Featured game: **Maria**

Maria is a game based on the War of the Austrian Succession, where Austria was attacked by Prussia, France, Bavaria and Saxony, while only Great Britain, Hanover and the Netherlands (by forming the so-called Pragmatic Army) helped her.

Maria is primarily a 3 player game. One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria's enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria's ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.

A 3 player specific wargame, Maria has a seen a little bit of talk in past TAWs. Have you gotten a chance to try this one? How do you feel about how it handles the balance of a 3-player conflict?

&lt;p&gt;What have you played this week? Any great plays or good stories? Any new acquisitions? What are you going to try and get to the table in the upcoming week?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featured game: &lt;strong&gt;Maria&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria is a game based on the War of the Austrian Succession, where Austria was attacked by Prussia, France, Bavaria and Saxony, while only Great Britain, Hanover and the Netherlands (by forming the so-called Pragmatic Army) helped her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria is primarily a 3 player game. One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria&amp;#39;s enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria&amp;#39;s ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A 3 player specific wargame, Maria has a seen a little bit of talk in past TAWs. Have you gotten a chance to try this one? How do you feel about how it handles the balance of a 3-player conflict?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr/&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Featured topic: Are there any interesting historical or fictional setting you feel that are underserved in the war game market? If you could have a game created about any war or battle, what would it be?&lt;/p&gt;

First of all, this is my first post and English is not my first language so if i write something stupid please bear with me.

So, i looking for a board game which i play around 1-2 years ago. 

The game have a short story : The head of the family die and everyone (Son, Daughter, Wife, Maid, Butler, Chef, Gardener etc.) want the heritage.

the element of the game is similar to Coup so here is the rule.

      1.) Around 4-8 people (not sure)

      2.) You can lie to be any role however if you got caught you cannot use that role skill any more

      3.) If you caught someone specific role then that person got eliminate and you will be the only one who know that card, However if you guess it wrong then u lost

      4.) Each tern you pick a coin (3 Type: Money Wisdom and im not sure about the last one)

      5.) When you get enough coin you can use action by asking another player the role then he/she will put his card mix with 3 other card

      6.) Funny thing is one side of the card praised the head and another side bitching about him

I really want to know thanks everyone

Note: The pictures are not indicative of an actual game - the setup was set up simply to showcase the pieces and quality.

Hermetica is an abstract strategy game from first time game developers IFF Studios. It is the first game I ever backed because I loved the gameplay (they have a working web app that was set up before the Kickstarter went live) and wanted to see these guys get their product to market. I paid $40 per copy if I remember correctly. You can pre-order it from their site now for $50. I purchased two copies - one for me and one for a friend who also loves abstract strategy games.

Components:

The boxes are long and slender (think Onitama but almost twice as long) and look great, but fit on my shelf poorly (also like Onitama). Inside the box is a sectioned off area for a slim rulebook, a set of rule reminder cards, and the rubber and cloth board. Another pocket is sectioned off for a drawstring bag and holds the playing pieces. The pieces consist of wooden hexagonal terrain pieces and metal and epoxy playing pieces. The mat is stitched along the edges and the printing quality is top notch. Overall the box, board, and pieces all have a premium feel to them. 

**NOTE:** After posting this I have found some small defects in my second copy. See the bottom of the post and comments for more details. 


Rules overview:

For the gameplay, if you like puzzly abstracts this game will be right up your alley. You have an adept piece which can move and place a shield (like a terrain piece), 3 fire pieces which can move long distances and over obstacles or shoot to capture pieces, 3 earth pieces which can push pieces and captures them by pushing them into obstacles, and 3 water pieces which move until they hit an obstacle and can move obstacles or pieces they collide with. When a piece is captured it is removed from the game for good. 

Each turn you get three actions. You can spend an action to activate a piece once or spend two actions to place a piece. Each piece can only be activated once per turn. You start with only the adept in play and it is the only piece that can be replaced when captured. To win the game you simply need to move the Adept piece into your opponents placement area (back edge of the board).

Reaction: 

The game is extremely fun to play. The rules are simple but there's a lot of interaction between piece types giving it a lot of depth. Being forced to place pieces instead of starting with a set amount in play allows players to really try different strategies. No dominant strategy emerged in our few playthroughs but we'll see how it plays out as we master the game. 

The fire piece is fun being that it can play games with the walls and barriers but it can either move or shoot in a turn - not both. This makes it very threatening but it takes setup so it makes a great defensive piece. The water piece can be disruptive very easily but since it can only move in a straight line it's very predictable. That said, slamming into a wall or opponents piece and relocating it can really screw up your opponents plans while keeping a threatening position. The earth piece is incredibly flexible due to being able to help setup combos or threaten captures by smashing opposing pieces into obstacles. The adept and the shield it places is extremely important and is key to winning the game and of course is required to beat your opponent.

Overall all the pieces feel balanced and useful. There's a ton of depth and variety of play in this box. When you hit that combo that deletes opposing pieces it feels fantastic. Simple to learn and difficult to master certainly applies here. 

Although I love the gameplay and have no complaints with it I do have one complaint - the price. With the stitched board and premium pieces I would say the game does feel worth the $40 I paid. However, $50 just feels a tad bit much for what you get. I would like to see a version with cheaper components that would retail for around $25-30. Getting people to pick up an abstract game for $50 is a tall order. That said there are other abstract games priced similarly so if you're into them already you'll probably be used to paying out. Overall, my complaint is pretty subjective, but seeing something priced around the Onitama price range and component quality is something I feel would go a long way towards promoting the game.

TL;DR:

Hermetica is a fantastic abstract strategy game with premium components but comes in with a premium price point. It's well balanced and deep but simple to learn. If you like combo heavy and puzzly abstracts I'd heavily recommend giving it a look. The best thing is you can try it on their website through your browser for free.

So there you have it. Give Hermetica a try!

**EDIT:** There have been some complaints from the Kickstarter page as to manufacturing defects. I myself found two notable (but still relatively minor) defects in my second copy I had not opened before this post. See the thread below by ComradeBubba8 for more details.

If you're a stickler for flawless components you might want to give the game some time before you purchase in order for them to work the kinks out of the manufacturing process.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Game Pictures:

You have an adept piece which can move and place a shield (like a terrain piece), 3 fire pieces which can move long distances and over obstacles or shoot to capture pieces, 3 earth pieces which can push pieces and captures them by pushing them into obstacles, and 3 water pieces which move until they hit an obstacle and can move obstacles or pieces they collide with. When a piece is captured it is removed from the game for good. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each turn you get three actions. You can spend an action to activate a piece once or spend two actions to place a piece. Each piece can only be activated once per turn. You start with only the adept in play and it is the only piece that can be replaced when captured. To win the game you simply need to move the Adept piece into your opponents placement area (back edge of the board).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reaction: &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The game is extremely fun to play. The rules are simple but there&amp;#39;s a lot of interaction between piece types giving it a lot of depth. Being forced to place pieces instead of starting with a set amount in play allows players to really try different strategies. No dominant strategy emerged in our few playthroughs but we&amp;#39;ll see how it plays out as we master the game. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fire piece is fun being that it can play games with the walls and barriers but it can either move or shoot in a turn - not both. This makes it very threatening but it takes setup so it makes a great defensive piece. The water piece can be disruptive very easily but since it can only move in a straight line it&amp;#39;s very predictable. That said, slamming into a wall or opponents piece and relocating it can really screw up your opponents plans while keeping a threatening position. The earth piece is incredibly flexible due to being able to help setup combos or threaten captures by smashing opposing pieces into obstacles. The adept and the shield it places is extremely important and is key to winning the game and of course is required to beat your opponent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Overall all the pieces feel balanced and useful. There&amp;#39;s a ton of depth and variety of play in this box. When you hit that combo that deletes opposing pieces it feels fantastic. Simple to learn and difficult to master certainly applies here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although I love the gameplay and have no complaints with it I do have one complaint - the price. With the stitched board and premium pieces I would say the game does feel worth the $40 I paid. However, $50 just feels a tad bit much for what you get. I would like to see a version with cheaper components that would retail for around $25-30. Getting people to pick up an abstract game for $50 is a tall order. That said there are other abstract games priced similarly so if you&amp;#39;re into them already you&amp;#39;ll probably be used to paying out. Overall, my complaint is pretty subjective, but seeing something priced around the Onitama price range and component quality is something I feel would go a long way towards promoting the game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TL;DR:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hermetica is a fantastic abstract strategy game with premium components but comes in with a premium price point. It&amp;#39;s well balanced and deep but simple to learn. If you like combo heavy and puzzly abstracts I&amp;#39;d heavily recommend giving it a look. The best thing is you can try it on their website through your browser for free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So there you have it. Give Hermetica a try!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT:&lt;/strong&gt; There have been some complaints from the Kickstarter page as to manufacturing defects. I myself found two notable (but still relatively minor) defects in my second copy I had not opened before this post. See the thread below by ComradeBubba8 for more details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;re a stickler for flawless components you might want to give the game some time before you purchase in order for them to work the kinks out of the manufacturing process.&lt;/p&gt;

​

We're the developers of [Uncaged: World Fighters](http://uncaged-cards.com/) and we're doing an [AMA tomorrow!](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/)

​

It's a essentially a fighting game (like Street Fighter) played with cards instead of buttons, and each expansion set is based around a particular martial art. Both players pick a fighter and chip away at each other's health points until 1 hits zero using the technique cards. You've got special moves, different places to take the fight, and even a Stamina system!

​

In the past we've released digital titles such as [Starborn Anarkist](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/starborn-anarkist/id687779885?mt=8), and this was our first time creating a tabletop game!​

​

We're doing an AMA Tomorrow at 12PM EST and we're totally up for talking about the card game-- how we got it going, design thoughts and processes regarding mechanics, etc. or whatever else you folks are into these days!

​

We hope to see you there!

Roleplay didn't really emerge naturally and the tutorial, which has been praised a lot, really did seem to get in the way of creating RP. 

Another gripe is that many of the ""both choose"" scenes seemed to only concern one character. How can both characters answer, does my bum look big in this? That really threw a spanner in the works for RP as well.

How much does the narrative aspect of the game affect your enjoyment? Does the story matter? If so, how much?

While I enjoy Time Stories and have played every scenario, it always dragged towards the end because you had to keep repeating everything over and over. I realize that's the hook for Time Stories but it's annoying to me in practice. 


In the Choose your own adventure game, when you fail, it's not game ending. You get a small penalty and you continue. We even died a few times and the penalty was not bad. Whereas in Time Stories, messing up or rolling badly means you have to start over. That didn't happen in Choose your own adventure. 


Also there are multiple endings in Choose your own adventure. So it makes the game more replayable. 
We didn't even see half the cards so we will definitely be replaying this game. The game is also not what I expected. I thought it would be scary or like a murder mystery. But it was genuinely laugh out loud funny. My group and I found ourselves talking about it days later and laughing over the stuff that happened in the game. It was that memorable and fun.

&amp;#x200B;

My wife and I are slowly starting to build a collection of games, and naturally that leads me to YT or Dice Tower or another board game site to scour for ""Best 2 player games"" or whatever, and a whole bunch are recommended. I recently came across a game called Cinque Terre: The Five Villages. Watched some videos, looked interesting, go to Amazon...$150. Someone recommended Koi Pond: A Coy Card Game and when I go to Amazon or eBay...not a single listing. 

&amp;#x200B;

The quality of those two games aside, can anyone explain to me why this is? Is it because some games are older, eventually go out of print and become worth good $$$ over time because of supply/demand? I've been to some LGS before that have large stock...but do they mostly carry the new releases and consistent hits (Dominion, Ticket to Ride, so on)? If this happens with a game - any ideas where one might look? Just to try it I typed in those aforementioned games on local mktplace/craigslist, no luck. Or does it just come down to ""you missed the party this time around, you'd do well to keep up with the current releases and hits before they're 'gone forever'""?

#**Real life**

I've been orbiting the sun for nearly 30 years, I have three kids and a lovely wife. I'm from Denmark and I'm a psychologist. I spend my time working, with my family, playing board games and PS4. I also enjoy cooking, but certainly don't do it enough for it to qualify as a hobby. I look forward to not being chronically sleep-deprived at some point. 

**How did you get introduced to Board Gaming?** 

I've been playing board games for as long as I can remember, mostly traditional card games and simple kids/family games with both friends and family. I got a taste of modern board games years ago with **Betrayal at House on the Hill**, **Ticket to Ride** and **Battlestar Galactica** among others, but I never really realized how many other great games there were until years later. I had a detour with **Magic: The Gathering** for some years, before I realized I didn't like how much it cost, the distribution model in general and how difficult it was to share with friends and family. Even though I frequented an LGS with shelves stacked with board games, I assumed most were crap and they were too expensive anyway (I later realized they sold them at prices wayyy above MRSP). A thread on /r/magictcg about what other games people played ignited my curiosity and led me to this sub and this was that. My magic stuff in a box in a closet and my shelves are now filled with wonderful games.

#**Gaming habits**

**Do you customize your games? If so, can you describe one of the games you customized?**  

I don't. At least nothing that requires any sort of crafting or skills. I have bought metal coins for **Viticulture:EE** and I have the collector's edition of Scythe from the a charity auction (with my first insert on the way), but that's about it for now.

**How often do you play games? Who do you play with? Where do you play?** 

It varies a lot. Probably once or twice a week on average, but that has been higher. I've played a lot with my wife and with a group of friends from way back, but I haven't ever really had a regular gaming group. It seems that is changing though (hurray!). Most of my plays are at home, but I almost always bring games with me wherever I go, so I got plays in all over the place.

**Do you have a BGG profile you'd like to share?**

[erthule on BGG](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/user/erthule) - there's not much to see other than my collection and plays though.

&amp;nbsp;

#**Favorites**


**What is your Favorite Game and why?** 

I'll probably have to say **Roll for the Galaxy**. It's one of my most played games and one I can't see myself tiring of anytime soon. It packs such a satisfying game into so short a playtime that I can easily play 3 games back to back. There's a great feeling of escalation, occasional sweet combos and room for clever plays. Luck has it's place as well which can even the playing field a bit when playing with people new to the game. I like Race as well, but I prefer the tactility of the dice in Roll and the fact that every tile as text as well as iconography.
My runner ups include **Scythe**, **Spirit Island** and **Concordia**.

**Favorite gateway game?**

For a good long while it was **Isle of Skye**, as it hits a good balance between simple rules and satisfying gameplay with enough variation that I can play it again and again with tiring of it. **Sushi Go** has probably been the most successful with nongamers though. Right now it's tie between **Kingdomino** and **Happy Salmon**, depending on the crowd. I feared I would find **Kingdomino** too light, but I really like it and it's so simple people can literally be playing with 1-2 minutes. **Happy Salmon** just never fails to make people laugh.  

**Who is your Favorite Designer and why?** 

I don't know if I can really call that one yet. I feel like I still haven't played enough different games to tell, but there are names that'll definitely make me look twice: Uwe Rosenberg, Mac Gerdts, Kramer (and Kiesling), Antoine Bauza and both Brunos (Cathala probably edging out Faidutti if I have to choose). I look forward to having a better answer in a couple of years. 

**Who is your Favorite Publisher and why?** 

Another question I’m not quite sure I can give an adequate answer to yet, but so far it’s definitely Stonemaier Games. Jamey listens to his customers, has run very successful Kickstarters without exclusives, produces beautiful games and projects like My Little Scythe and Rise of Fenris shows that he is open to working with his fanbase to develop cool versions of stuff that with most other publishers would have remained fanmade PnPs.

**Favorite gaming mechanism?**

I love the mind games the often go with simultaneous action selection. **Mission: Red Planet** does it well, as does **Race/Roll for the Galaxy**. The tension is people reveal their choices is great in games that use it well. Asymmetric players powers and variable player powers (whether drafted/gathered during play or baked into factions/heroes) is a close second. Ask me again tomorrow and I’ll probably give a completely different answer though.

**Favorite gaming component?**

It's probably a tie between the realistic resources and metal coins from **Scythe** and the dice from **Roll for the Galaxy**. Runner-up: cubes from basically any game that lets you hoard cubes (e.g. **Grand Austria Hotel** and **Lords of Waterdeep**). I don't know what it is about them, they just make me feel good inside.

**What game can you not stand or refuse to play?** 

I can’t think of any game I would flat out refuse to play if a friend really wanted to, but I won’t miss **Phase 10**, **Rage**, **Boss Monster** or **Munchkin** if I never play them again. Of more popular games, **Betrayal at House on the Hill** excited me greatly when I first heard of it as well as the first 4-5 times I played it. Now I actively avoid it – the randomness, total lack of balance and unclear rules make the game boring for me. Also, **Battlestar Galactica** is way too long for my tastes for what it is.

&amp;nbsp;

#**Versus**

|Fight! | Winner!|  
| ---------:|:----------|  
| Theme vs. Mechanics | Mechanics (I’ll play an unthematic game with great mechanics, but not the inverse) |  
| Logs plays vs just remembering | Logs |  
| Sleeved vs. Natural cards | Natural(but only because I'm lazy and cheap and I do sleeve some games that require heavy shuffling) |  
| Euro vs. Ameritrash | Euro |  
| Splendor vs. Century: Spice Road | Century |  
| Race for the Galaxy vs. Roll for the Galaxy | **Roll** all the way |
| Cubes vs. Meeples | Cubes |
| Master few games or experience many different | Both? There are still so many great games I haven’t tried, that I’m always eager to try more, but for my collection I prefer fewer games that consistently hit the table |
| Long vs short games | Short |

&amp;nbsp;

#**Q &amp; A**

**Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?**

I do. It’s fun and I like to go over my collection regularly and update the scores. I like data and numbers, and I use them to guide how I cull/curate my collection. I think a numerical rating in isolation has limited utility, but in large amounts they can be meaningful. I have not rated a ten yet, but I’ve been close a couple of times. I don’t think I could ever rate a game 10 before I had played it a significant amount of times. I have issues with the BGG scale, but I still use it with only slight changes. The official BGG scale equates a 10 to something I’ll never tire of playing – I’m not sure that applies to any game for me, but that doesn’t mean no game can deserve a 10. **Pandemic: Legacy Season 1** came close, but the end ruined it for me (I downgraded it to a 9.5).

&amp;nbsp;

**Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?**

I like both types, but at heart I’m probably mostly a Euro gamer. I love efficiency puzzles, engine building, streamlined rules without too much luck and very limited destructive player interaction (outside of war games). I don’t think the categories are a *sufficient* way to describe games anymore, but I do think they’re still a meaningful way of describing the core design philosophy/goal behind games. Euros games are at heart about solving puzzles, feeling clever or being efficient. Ameritrash is about drama, narrative/theme and tension (which output luck has a tendency to create). I do think there are a lot of good games today that draw on both schools of design and the waters have generally been muddied so a lot of games are difficult to classify as entirely one or the other, which I definitely consider a boon.

&amp;nbsp;

**What does /r/boardgames mean to you?**

Without this sub, I wouldn’t have found this hobby. It’s where I learn of new games, get a sense of what’s hot, find out which classics I’ve missed out on, find great board game related content like podcasts and review channels, and where I read and engage in discussions about games. I’ve spent time in a bunch of different subs, but /r/boardgames stand out in the tone and quality of a lot of the discussions and posts. It’s a great community that I’m proud to be a part of.

&amp;nbsp;

**What are your thoughts on crowdfunding board games? What's your favorite crowdfunded game?**

Short answer: I’m tempted more than I wish I was. I have backed a handful of games in the last two years or so, but I do try to wait for retail for most projects. I really dislike the way FOMO is used to drive sales, but I do like when it’s used to offer a great deal to the backer or when it helps bring games to the market that probably wouldn’t have made it through the regular channels (**Gloomhaven** being an obvious example of this). **Gloomhaven** is probably my favorite crowdfunded game, but I do like both **Scythe** and **Blood Rage** (I was not a backer of either) and **Rising Sun** (which I did back) as well.

&amp;nbsp;

**How many games are in your collection? Are you satisfied with that number?** 

Including expansions I’m just short of 100, which I think is way too many. I love trying new games and I’m the only real “collector” in my social circle, so I usually have to buy a game if I want to try it. This leads me to have a collection that sees regular rotation. I think I’ve traded away or sold about 40 games so far (mostly through a FB-group). I’d love to be able to get my collection down to a maximum of 70-80 games (about a 25-35% percent of which are small box games that don’t take up a lot of space), which is still more than I need but lets me have great variety in terms of differing playtime, player count, weight and genres. I prefer to not have games in my collection that don’t see some kind of regular play, but it can be hard to get rid of a game I really like, just because I haven’t found a group for it yet.

&amp;nbsp;


**If you could only keep 10 games in your collection, what 10 would they be?** 

This list is would change based on mood and what I’ve been playing lately, and it is not the same as my top 10, as I would want as much variety as possible. It’s also not ordered in any way. But probably something like this:  
- **Scythe**  
- **Roll for the Galaxy**   
- **Spirit Island**  
- **Castles of Burgundy**    
- **Kingdomino**  
- **Concordia**  
- **Viticulture: Essential Edition**   
- **Rising Sun**  
- **Bärenpark** or **Potion Explosion**  
- **No Thanks** or **For Sale**  

The last three especially could be exchanged for any number of great games. Man, these lists are hard!
&amp;nbsp;


**Is there anything else you'd like to add?** 

Thanks for your time! Feel free to ask any questions below. 
Also, if anyone out there really like these posts and want to get involved, send me a message – my time is limited and I would love to share or pass the reins on to someone with more time on their hands than I.

&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Both? There are still so many great games I haven’t tried, that I’m always eager to try more, but for my collection I prefer fewer games that consistently hit the table&lt;/td&gt;

&lt;td align=""right""&gt;Long vs short games&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td align=""left""&gt;Short&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q &amp;amp; A&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you give numerical ratings to games? How many games have you rated a 10? What does a 10 mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I do. It’s fun and I like to go over my collection regularly and update the scores. I like data and numbers, and I use them to guide how I cull/curate my collection. I think a numerical rating in isolation has limited utility, but in large amounts they can be meaningful. I have not rated a ten yet, but I’ve been close a couple of times. I don’t think I could ever rate a game 10 before I had played it a significant amount of times. I have issues with the BGG scale, but I still use it with only slight changes. The official BGG scale equates a 10 to something I’ll never tire of playing – I’m not sure that applies to any game for me, but that doesn’t mean no game can deserve a 10. &lt;strong&gt;Pandemic: Legacy Season 1&lt;/strong&gt; came close, but the end ruined it for me (I downgraded it to a 9.5).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you consider yourself a Euro gamer or Ameritrash gamer or a hybrid? Do you think the two categories are meaningful?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like both types, but at heart I’m probably mostly a Euro gamer. I love efficiency puzzles, engine building, streamlined rules without too much luck and very limited destructive player interaction (outside of war games). I don’t think the categories are a &lt;em&gt;sufficient&lt;/em&gt; way to describe games anymore, but I do think they’re still a meaningful way of describing the core design philosophy/goal behind games. Euros games are at heart about solving puzzles, feeling clever or being efficient. Ameritrash is about drama, narrative/theme and tension (which output luck has a tendency to create). I do think there are a lot of good games today that draw on both schools of design and the waters have generally been muddied so a lot of games are difficult to classify as entirely one or the other, which I definitely consider a boon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; mean to you?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without this sub, I wouldn’t have found this hobby. It’s where I learn of new games, get a sense of what’s hot, find out which classics I’ve missed out on, find great board game related content like podcasts and review channels, and where I read and engage in discussions about games. I’ve spent time in a bunch of different subs, but &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; stand out in the tone and quality of a lot of the discussions and posts. It’s a great community that I’m proud to be a part of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What are your thoughts on crowdfunding board games? What&amp;#39;s your favorite crowdfunded game?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Short answer: I’m tempted more than I wish I was. I have backed a handful of games in the last two years or so, but I do try to wait for retail for most projects. I really dislike the way FOMO is used to drive sales, but I do like when it’s used to offer a great deal to the backer or when it helps bring games to the market that probably wouldn’t have made it through the regular channels (&lt;strong&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/strong&gt; being an obvious example of this). &lt;strong&gt;Gloomhaven&lt;/strong&gt; is probably my favorite crowdfunded game, but I do like both &lt;strong&gt;Scythe&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;Blood Rage&lt;/strong&gt; (I was not a backer of either) and &lt;strong&gt;Rising Sun&lt;/strong&gt; (which I did back) as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How many games are in your collection? Are you satisfied with that number?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Including expansions I’m just short of 100, which I think is way too many. I love trying new games and I’m the only real “collector” in my social circle, so I usually have to buy a game if I want to try it. This leads me to have a collection that sees regular rotation. I think I’ve traded away or sold about 40 games so far (mostly through a FB-group). I’d love to be able to get my collection down to a maximum of 70-80 games (about a 25-35% percent of which are small box games that don’t take up a lot of space), which is still more than I need but lets me have great variety in terms of differing playtime, player count, weight and genres. I prefer to not have games in my collection that don’t see some kind of regular play, but it can be hard to get rid of a game I really like, just because I haven’t found a group for it yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If you could only keep 10 games in your collection, what 10 would they be?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This list is would change based on mood and what I’ve been playing lately, and it is not the same as my top 10, as I would want as much variety as possible. It’s also not ordered in any way. But probably something like this:&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Scythe&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Roll for the Galaxy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Spirit Island&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Castles of Burgundy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Kingdomino&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Concordia&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Viticulture: Essential Edition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Rising Sun&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;Bärenpark&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Potion Explosion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
- &lt;strong&gt;No Thanks&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;For Sale&lt;/strong&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last three especially could be exchanged for any number of great games. Man, these lists are hard!
&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Is there anything else you&amp;#39;d like to add?&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for your time! Feel free to ask any questions below. 
Also, if anyone out there really like these posts and want to get involved, send me a message – my time is limited and I would love to share or pass the reins on to someone with more time on their hands than I. &lt;/p&gt;

I ordered the Mage Knight Quick Start insert from Daedalus Productions and received it about five weeks later. As other redditors have mentioned, that company doesn't communicate much and takes awhile to ship their products, since most kits are made-to-order.

Now that all the waiting is out of the way, I'm happy with the insert! 

**Build**

The stained finish looks gorgeous, and the kit was easy to punch out and put together. The written instructions recommend using wood glue, but the instruction videos on the Daedalus website recommend superglue. I opted for superglue with great results, and I didn't end up needing to use any sandpaper.

This is my first tabletop insert, and it felt a little like I was putting together some kind of [wooden Gunpla kit.](https://i.imgur.com/2pR0lHd.jpg)

**Specifics**

I can already tell the labeled card slots alone are going to speed up setup and teardown by orders of magnitude. Instead of having a huge lump of cards smashed into one spot in the plastic insert, each card type has a home.

The thing that sold me on this kit versus the Broken Token insert is the character tray design; each character's tokens are all separated, and each player can take one tray to get going right away. No more plastic baggies full of fiddly pieces.

An awesome redditor sent me some [acrylic stones](https://i.imgur.com/9bChpFR.jpg) to replace the lackluster mana crystals that came with the game. A simple thing like replacing some mediocre components with sharper-looking gems drastically improved the ""feel"" of this game on the table. You can find similar bits with a search for ""acrylic rocks"" on Amazon.

**TL;DR**- This insert took 5 weeks to arrive, but it's rad and totally worth the wait.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In Red Dragon Inn, you and your friends are a party of heroic, fantasy adventurers. You've raided the dungeon, killed the monsters, and taken their treasure. Now you're back, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game.

The four characters are Deirdre the Priestess, Fiona the Volatile, Gerki the Sneak, and Zot the Wizard.

Cartagena","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long story short: my mom stumbled across an estate sale held by an older man who was selling all his board games for $1/each. She left, messaged me the pictures, I told her to go back and buy them all. She got the lot for $25 and walked away with 72 games and/or expansions, all in like-new condition and very well cared for. She&amp;#39;s probably going to sell a bunch of these, but she&amp;#39;s also told me I can keep any that I want as long as I play them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

First of all, we all really enjoyed the story and gameplay. The rulebook gave us lots of helpful tips to help us focus our efforts. We spent about 3 hours in actual gameplay and maybe 20 minutes going over rules, setting up, creating an online account, and prepping for the first case.

I really enjoy the way the case makes you feel like a real detective going around, pulling together ideas, and deciding which areas are more worth your time. The concept of a limited amount of time is a great idea and helps keep us focused where Sherlock Holmes found us wandering around until we felt like we'd exhausted every avenue of thought. I will almost certainly go back once we've beaten the case and read through the cards to find out more information on loose threads, but I feel like this game is a wonderful amalgam of the best parts of SH:CD and T.I.M.E. Stories. Its strength is creating a genuine feel of being a detective and giving players a rewarding experience when you solve a case.

Overall, I highly recommend if you're an analytical person who enjoys co-ops or just someone who wants to solve some crimes and play a more story driven game.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having played a handful of Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective games and never managing to beat it, I wanted to try something more modern with a similarly loosely connected overarching story.

I think their model of reviving old games for today’s boardgame community is a great one… there are a lot of old games that could use a fresh coat of paint and a tweaked ruleset. I’ve played the restored Downforce numerous times, and as an old fan of Stop Thief!, I look forward to playing that one, too. I don’t have any such attachment to Fireball Island, but the production looks impressive.

Of course, they’ve recently made waves with the plan to restore the big mama of early 80s boardgaming, Dark Tower. I’m excited by this prospect, and yet I have my doubts.

To wit: Is it even possible to release a contemporary version of Dark Tower? Or at least is it possible to re-release it and stay true to what made the game a landmark? Restoration clearly understands the challenge.  The essential question guiding their restoration is: What is the soul of the game?  In their press release, Restoration President Justin Jacobson nails it: “For Dark Tower, no question, it was that cutting-edge gizmo fused with a grand fantasy setting.”

The “cutting-edge gizmo”… therein lies the challenge. The “wow factor” of Dark Tower was entirely wrapped up in the eponymous tower, which at the time represented something close to a state-of-the-art fusion of technology and gaming. How can that wow factor be recaptured, now that the fusion of gaming and technology has moved so far beyond the gizmo stage for which Dark Tower represented the apotheosis?

In an interview at GenCon, Jacobson shared that the central gizmo won’t be a tower structure into which you can simply slot your phone and run the game on an app, which from a contemporary design standpoint, is a model that makes a good deal of sense. But as Jacobson correctly realizes, that would be, well, boring. And if there’s one thing the re-release of Dark Tower can’t be, it’s boring.

But with technology at its current level, where we’re no longer impressed by a mere app (which nonetheless can deliver a far more nuanced game experience than Dark Tower’s rudimentary mechanics), is it even possible to push the boundaries in the same way? Certainly, turning over the gameplay redesign to the superduo of Rob Daviau &amp; Isaac Childres is an encouraging move. But their contributions might ultimately be less important than those of the digital/mechanical engineers who are tasked with delivering a game component that’s got to live up to its predecessor, which dominated a far less crowded field by surpassing far lower expectations and technical specs.    

How does Restoration pull this one off? It’s a fantastically ambitious idea, but I see a whole lot of ways it can fail. What do you all think? ","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a fan of Restoration Games. I think their model of reviving old games for today’s boardgame community is a great one… there are a lot of old games that could use a fresh coat of paint and a tweaked ruleset. I’ve played the restored Downforce numerous times, and as an old fan of Stop Thief!, I look forward to playing that one, too. I don’t have any such attachment to Fireball Island, but the production looks impressive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, they’ve recently made waves with the plan to restore the big mama of early 80s boardgaming, Dark Tower. I’m excited by this prospect, and yet I have my doubts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To wit: Is it even possible to release a contemporary version of Dark Tower? Or at least is it possible to re-release it and stay true to what made the game a landmark? Restoration clearly understands the challenge.  The essential question guiding their restoration is: What is the soul of the game?  In their press release, Restoration President Justin Jacobson nails it: “For Dark Tower, no question, it was that cutting-edge gizmo fused with a grand fantasy setting.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The “cutting-edge gizmo”… therein lies the challenge. The “wow factor” of Dark Tower was entirely wrapped up in the eponymous tower, which at the time represented something close to a state-of-the-art fusion of technology and gaming. How can that wow factor be recaptured, now that the fusion of gaming and technology has moved so far beyond the gizmo stage for which Dark Tower represented the apotheosis?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview at GenCon, Jacobson shared that the central gizmo won’t be a tower structure into which you can simply slot your phone and run the game on an app, which from a contemporary design standpoint, is a model that makes a good deal of sense. But as Jacobson correctly realizes, that would be, well, boring. And if there’s one thing the re-release of Dark Tower can’t be, it’s boring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with technology at its current level, where we’re no longer impressed by a mere app (which nonetheless can deliver a far more nuanced game experience than Dark Tower’s rudimentary mechanics), is it even possible to push the boundaries in the same way? Certainly, turning over the gameplay redesign to the superduo of Rob Daviau &amp;amp; Isaac Childres is an encouraging move. But their contributions might ultimately be less important than those of the digital/mechanical engineers who are tasked with delivering a game component that’s got to live up to its predecessor, which dominated a far less crowded field by surpassing far lower expectations and technical specs.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How does Restoration pull this one off? It’s a fantastically ambitious idea, but I see a whole lot of ways it can fail. What do you all think? &lt;/p&gt;

I've posted before about how we felt like Pandemic Legacy Season 2 was much harder.

After finishing our second game in September giving us a 7-8 record (losing right before the last turn when the 5% chance thing happened, again), we decided to spoil the rest of the game and finish playing. The was not a decision we came to lightly, as we **loved** Pandemic Legacy Season 1.

But with season 2, we found that the variability on experiences was so immense that we just weren't having fun anymore. It was entirely frustrating and we decided to spoil the rest of the months.

 Here was a bit about our experience:

* We never found a single lab
* We knew we had to search certain areas, but every search just gave us companions or immediate effects. We did find 2 havens though.
* We didn't even get the lab rule sticker until July or August.
* Almost every time we finally did the recon action, the game just gave us whatever that was the next time - so we were basically only one step ahead, which is frustrating when you spend a lot of time finishing a goal, still lose the game, and then just get it anyway.
* Often, we could tell by turn 2 if we were going to win or lose the game based on how the opening infect went.


We adjusted our play styles to account for some of this, like moving cubes from cities that weren't hit a little bit faster, but even so, we felt like the entire opening is a guessing game. If you guessed wrong and got an early epidemic, then you were guaranteed 2-3 incidents right away. 

I think their goal was to outdo themselves, and I think they had a combination of successes and failures. Here are some things I thought were not as good as they could have been.

* The goal to create 5 supply centers was present for 3/4 of the game. Rather than evolve the main goal of the game, we were pretty much playing the same thing the entire time.
* New mechanics were added for the sake of adding variability, since the main goal was the same. Take the shelters, for instance, they come out, and we use them right away because why not, use some production points to make them permanent in a troubled area, and then that's it.
* Since the deck gets so massive, it becomes harder and harder to find the searches you need. If you don't ever draw the card you need to search the lab, or can't get down there, you just won't find it. This is a huge flaw in the game IMHO.
* The player deck overall is an issue. The size gets way out of hand. Even if you inoculate a bunch it's still going to be rather large, because to inoculate you have to be in a city that matches one in the discard pile already, so it's not going to happen too early in the game, and then only when it matches. I think we realized we need to thin the deck a bit a little too late, but even so, one mechanic like that shouldn't make the rest of the game impossible.

* We also made some rules mistakes early in the game that weighted the board more heavily against us - forgot to adjust population of supply centers upward. We caught this pretty early, maybe game 3, and gave ourselves some extra population in some supply center cities
* The general coordinates of where to search for labs was on some flavor card in the legacy deck. We totally overlooked this for a game, maybe two, which was a problem. I didn't like that something as important as that was hidden in what is usually only flavor.


The excitement of seeing how the story evolved, the excitement of adding new cities to the grid, the excitement of getting new cards. All of this sharply decreased from game to game as we just lost, and lost, and lost. New mechanics felt like something tedious, not a new spin on the game, and none of them really made anything easier for us because the rest of the game was so difficult.

We felt totally out of control vs. fate, and advanced most months after the 2nd try. So we felt like we were just along for the ride, and that became not very enjoyable.

The sad part is, when we approximated our score on the scoring card, assuming we continued with our bad luck and maybe got a little lucky once, our score was around average/middle. Which means to say, on a bell curve, our kind of experience would be the fairly common if not the most common.

Maybe we had the outlier experience! Or maybe we were just awful players, I would never rule that out - my ego is not that precious.


**TL;DR** - got absolutely destroyed by pandemic legacy and it felt like there was nothing we could to about it. The game become so ""unfun"" we spoiled the last 3 months and threw it out.

One of the things that draws me to board gaming is the complete unreliance on technology. I like my games to be able to last a lifetime so I can pass it on to the next generation.

Also, it's always nice to a) know you'll have something to do when the power goes out and b) take a break from our technologically swamped lives.

I loved escape-the-room flash games as a kid, and I love TIME stories. The aesthetic appeal of Unlock! is perfect, and it looks like something that would be amazing for my collection.

However, because of the reliance on an app, I will not buy it.

I was wondering if there was anyway, even via creative means (such as buying additional components etc.) that I could make this game playable without the app?

For example, I purchased 5 minute dungeon, but I bought a 5 minute hourglass timer instead of using the app and it's perfect.

Also, EXIT looks good but the fact that it's a one-shot is disheartening. As I said I like my games to be able to last so I can pass them along.

Any help will be much appreciated! 

Thanks.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey y&amp;#39;all,&lt;/p&gt;

A little background on my tastes - over the last year I discovered by love for boardgames, and especially the ones on the heavier side. I'm the proud owner of Great Western Trail, Orleans, and Spirit Island for example (among others). To me these great games have one thing in common,  as do all great board games really, in that there's luck involved, but it's always a situation where you **manage your luck**. As in, draw 3 cards but keep one. That is the best way, to me there's no doubt, to implement luck in a board game. Where there's a shuffle of some sort, you get some options, and you must decide within the hand you've been dealt, what best suits your situation.

Just recently I played Catan for the very first time with a friend who had recently acquired and was excited about it. I knew Catan was probably decent, but I had my qualms with its dice rolling. Lo and behold, I mildly enjoyed the experienced, and inevitably felt I wouldn't enjoy it long term due to the game's heavy reliance on the results of the dice. And worst, there's nothing you can do after the dice is rolled. There is no decision management at all post-luck, just luck itself in the moment that the dice are rolled. Over and over. A person might win the game with 3 lucky draws and nobody can prevent it. Nowadays I barely entertain the idea of a game having dice to decide situations. It's one of the reasons I've mostly avoided Castles of Burgundy, even though from what I've read that game feels like you are managing your luck because, as I understand it, you get to pick where you place your dice. 

So anyway, this brings me to Root. My group doesn't have a war game and I would like to introduce that concept, and Root feels like the right place to start, with all the hype going around and some people saying it's the perfect game to introduce people to War games. The theme and art seem awesome, as does the asymmetry, which I very much appreciate. But reading the rules and from what people comment, it seems like the dice are very much a deciding factor in winning battles, and the worst part is that winning battles and defeating foes IS a major way to win the game. This is making me very, very hesitant of actually getting Root. I cannot tolerate luck-heavy oriented games anymore and I'm afraid that mechanic will ruin the game for our group.

So I ask, for people who have played Root, what do you think? Is it really a core concept of WINNING the game that you have to have the dice rule in your favor constantly? That would surely be a deal breaker for me.

Thanks for reading.

Happy Tuesday, /r/boardgames!

This is a weekly thread to discuss train games and 18xx games, which are a family of economic train games consisting of shared ownership in railroad companies. For more information, [see the description on BGG](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgamefamily/19/18xx). There’s also a subreddit devoted entirely to 18xx games, /r/18xx, and a subreddit devoted entirely to **[Age of Steam](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/4098/age-steam)**, /r/AgeOfSteam.

Here’s a nice guide on [how to get started with 18xx](https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/4sygx3/how_to_get_started_with_18xx/?st=iqny4loj&amp;sh=c01b5d88).

Feel free to discuss anything about train games, including recent plays, what you're looking forward to, and any questions you have. 

If you want to arrange to play some 18xx or other train games online, feel free to try to arrange a game with people via /r/playboardgames.

Let me be clear, I'm not sure if this is a consensus or even an highly shared opinion. I think The Dice Tower mentioned this a few times, maybe that gave me the impression that the community had the same opinion. 

Anyway, I bring the subject because I always thought **Race** was the easier game to teach. It seems so much straightforward in comparison to me. 5 phases, each player simultaneously choose which to activate, and they're all pretty easy to teach by themselves. Then comes the iconography which some people blow out of proportion (usually, it's the main argument given when arguing that **Race** is a hassle to teach.) I don't get why though. There's barely any variety in the symbols used and the more esoteric ones have a textual explanation on the card itself.

On the other hand, I find that **Roll** is a bit harder to teach, not much but still. I guess I feel the dice assignment is less intuitive gameplay-wise than just selecting an action from your hand, i.e. selecting one main action with your dice and potentially other secondary actions compared to just choosing a card in your hand.

There's a game a friend of mine had like 12 years ago. Fabric mat, disk magnets black on one side white on the other, mat has large circle.

The magnets were designed such that you could lay one flat and then ""lean"" magnets against the flat ones. If you had steady hands you could even lean magnets against other magnets. Eventually there are too many magnets on the board and someone disrupts the balance and a bunch of magnets connect. Your opponent takes the magnets that connect or leave the circle on your turn, and the number of magnets is your score to win.

I have a group of around 40 close friends that I invite every other week to a game night I host. I started collecting board games in May 2018 after I got my promotion at work. I’ve been buying a bunch of games that I see on Game the Game of Tabletop that I thought looked enjoyable. We’ve only had 3 game nights to this point but I noticed a small problem

We usually have too many people. Sometimes someone is sitting out. We have had attendance of 6, 9, 5 at game nights since we started hosting. The second night was difficult as I have games for that many people like Secret Hitler, Formula D, Tsuro (which we had the loser sit out but then someone said they were tired and went home so it worked out). 

I offered to split the group so that we had more diversity and I’d play two games at once that way I could help both groups with the rules but people didn’t seem to want to do that. Most of the games I have are for 5-6 players at most. 

So the big question here is, how do I get people who may want to split off into different groups to player smaller games so that we can have more diversity during game night. A lot of people, I feel, want to try a new game to sample what they like, but are afraid to mess up the rules. I also think that as people start to come “regularly” (I.e only 3 people have been to all 3 game nights so far) they will start to learn the games they like and then want to play those games instead.

Anyways looking for suggestions!

## What this is:

 This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:

 - **newly posted in the past 7 days**, or
 - **ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)** and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.

 All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)

 Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.

&lt;p&gt;This is a weekly, curated listing of Kickstarter tabletop games projects that are either:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;newly posted in the past 7 days&lt;/strong&gt;, or&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ending in the next 7 days (starting tomorrow)&lt;/strong&gt; and have at least a fighting chance of being funded.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All board game projects meeting those criteria will automatically be included, no need to ask. (But the occasional non-board game project may also sneak in!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expect new lists each Sunday sometime between 12:00am and 12:00pm PST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s possible that it was the rum, but, god damn is that a fun game. Unfortunately most of my friends are a little too shallow to get into something like this, but I can&amp;#39;t wait to look into some new ones and introduce friends (maybe meet new people) to them. I grew up in family that bonded around strategic card games, so this seems to fit just right.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;m my regular group, this has gradually been getting worse with certain players, and I&amp;#39;m thinking about bringing it up. But I don&amp;#39;t just want to roll in saying &amp;#39;hey this is a problem&amp;#39; without having thought it through and maybe had having some compromises on hand. And I also don&amp;#39;t want to just call out a couple people because I don&amp;#39;t know what&amp;#39;s going on in their lives, and I don&amp;#39;t want them to feel like they have to justify it if they need to take a call ore respond to a message. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Do you all have any group rules for cell phone use during long or complicated games? How did you decide what rules to have? Do you have phone breaks for long games? Do you pause the game while people are on the phone? Would it be crazy to ask that phones be kept on vibrate? And is there a tactful way to bring this up with my usual group, or to ask about phone use when I&amp;#39;m being invited to play somewhere new, or to mention it when I&amp;#39;m having new people over to game?&lt;/p&gt;

This game is intended to be Kickstarted in October 2018, however the game is still undergoing some significant game-balance revision. I have permission from Alex at GFG to discuss the game (see [my BGG thread](https://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/2052868/preview-beta-test-reavers-midgard) on the same), but I'm not going to post an exhaustive manual of the game in this space given its beta status (nor do I want to share anything approaching IP). I've seen enough to tell you what Reavers of Midgard (RoM) is, and I'll explain it by comparing it to other popular games, including its spiritual predecessor, Champions of Midgard (CoM).

&amp;#x200B;

**Summary of RoM**

*Players:* 2 to 5, but I think 4 players is the intended best? There is chatter of some solo rules, but nothing I've seen playtested

*Chief Mechanics:* Resource management (moderate), set completion, drafting, simple worker placement, synergy. There's not enough combat in the current version to justify that keyword, unlike CoM.

*Weight (BGG scale):* If Puerto Rico is a 3.29, and Terra Mystica is a 3.95, then the current incarnation of RoM is about a 3.4 to 3.5. Yes, that's significantly heavier than CoM's 2.53.

*Describe RoM in a tweet:* Recruit Reaver cards and warrior dice, then deploy them to conquer territories, raid keeps, and battle at sea! Collect special abilities to improve your strategy, and sets of rewards for increasing Glory!

&amp;#x200B;

**The ""Feel"" of Playing RoM**

Like CoM, the theme of RoM is of competing Viking bands who enrich themselves and defend the homeland from threats. The playtest version of course didn't have the assistance of art to capture the theme of the actions, but the result is that, when you declare a Battle action or a Recruit action or a Trade, everyone participates if they are able, but as the leader of that action you will get the choicest spoils, and your peers that are ill-equipped to join you on your exploits won't get their share.

&amp;#x200B;

RoM is technically a ""worker placement"" game, but the phrase is more true of CoM than this one; you get one worker, and you are essentially choosing one of six locations on the board. You'll be first to complete the actions instructed and nab the resources there, but then the other players will take the same action, in order, with diminishing returns. In this respect, the game mimics **Puerto Rico's** phase drafting, but represents it with worker placement on the board. However, opponents that do not have the required resources cannot participate in the same action, so plotting certain actions while your opponent is unable to share in the gains is strategically necessary.

&amp;#x200B;

You'll spend the game ultimately trying to acquire victory points (""Glory""), some of which are scored immediately, and some of which are tallied at the end of the game. To do so, you will acquire other resources that you will spend to gain said Glory. Some resources are simple, such as food, which is required to participate in some actions such as Raiding Keeps. Some resources are complex, such as the Reaver cards and the warrior dice that you draft. There are six locations on the board, and all of them involve gaining resources and/or cards and dice.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an example board location, the ""Raid Keeps"" action, which has the following steps:

1. Spend 3 food and 2 shield dice
2. Draft a column of Spoils cards
3. Draw bonus Spoils cards (2/1/0/0/0)

&amp;#x200B;

Being your action during the Turn, you place your worker on the Raid Keeps location. You spend the food and dice required, then you choose one of three vertical columns of Spoils cards to take. Let's say you see one card with a matching icon to one you've already collected, so you draft that column for increasingly larger set completion bonuses. Finally, you draw two bonus Spoils cards from the top of the deck.

&amp;#x200B;

Your opponent to your left doesn't have enough food or dice to participate (which you knew), so she must ""pass"", instead drafting one warrior die of her choice. The next opponent does spend the food and dice, and drafts one of the remaining columns of Spoils cards. He then draws 1 bonus Spoils card as shown by the numbers in the slashes. The last opponent in a four-player game also spends the food and dice, opts for a single Spoils card from the deck (an alternative to the remaining column of Spoils cards), and then gets no bonus cards as shown by the slash numbers. This ends your action and the player on your left now places their worker.

&amp;#x200B;

**Warrior Dice, Reavers, and Comparisons to CoM**

In CoM, the primary mechanic is the warrior dice, which are worth nothing at the end of the game, but are committed to battle in order to (hopefully) defeat monsters for glory, set bonuses, and more resources and dice.

&amp;#x200B;

In RoM, dice behave differently: you roll the dice when *drafted*, not in combat. The faceup side of the die defines that warrior's role or particular training; you need Shield dice or Boat dice or Hammer dice, etc. to complete certain actions. The colors of the dice pertain to the possible outcomes of the die when you draft and roll it (i.e. blue dice can't roll Shields, but are the only dice to roll Trees). You simply spend dice as required, although occasionally you may be permitted to reroll one or more dice.

&amp;#x200B;

The primary mechanic in RoM are the namesake Reaver cards, which are like lieutenants for your warriors. These are gained via the Recruit Reavers action. When you draft a Reaver card, you gain several warrior dice as well, and this is the chief method to gain dice in the game. With this Reaver card, you can use it in three ways:

&amp;#x200B;

1. You can discard it to your endgame pile. Doing so provides you with bonus warrior dice indicated by the card.
2. You can place it in the leader side of your boat, the large card where you organize your resources and abilities. This bumps the former Reaver card into your endgame pile. The color of the Reaver indicates that dice *of that color* you possess are now ""wild"" and can be spent as any symbol on the die in certain circumstances. You also gain one of three rewards each time you promote a new Reaver, so you may prefer that benefit to the dice gained by discarding it.
3. Instead of the above, you can assign the Reaver to one of several ""engines"" at the bottom of your boat, which correspond to certain board actions, such as Raid Keeps. Whenever you complete the corresponding action, each Reaver card triggers a unique benefit printed on the card (for example, ""Draw a free Spoils card"").

&amp;#x200B;

**Maybe Not Heavy, Just Complex**

RoM isn't the kind of ""heavy"" where it overwhelms the player with myriad possible actions. Instead, RoM is the kind of game where it may not always be clear what the most profitable rewards are. Whereas in CoM the monsters were worth a static amount of points on the card plus a bonus for color sets, a reward set in RoM could be worth, say 1/3/6/10/15. So gaining a fifth card of the matching type is worth five points, but the sixth is worth only one point as you're starting a new set. While resources are worth little or no points after the game, it can be difficult determining which cards on the board may be ""worth"" the most to you. I'm not sure if its intentionally a complicated flux or marketplace, or my own inexperience with a game still under construction. It could also be a playtesting competition, to see which rewards players most enjoy to seek.

&amp;#x200B;

Many games choose to narrow the options to thematically and tactically reduce viable strategies, as well as shorten the game and force a resolution; instead, RoM seems to invite a large number of hybrid tactics and perhaps prevent competitive stymies. While in CoM you can take the best of two sources of a resource on the board, in Reavers there seems to be three ways to get every kind of resource, except the Reavers cards themselves and the static Sea Battle cards. Likewise, you're never swimming in resources (unless you do it intentionally), and you don't have to resource to accounting practices to track them.

&amp;#x200B;

So it's my assumption that RoM is intended to be a less directly-competitive, more ""personal sandbox"" style of worker placement/resource management game. This is one of the few games where it would take a concerted effort by the other players to keep you from getting something you clearly want; you're mostly likely to be stymied be others merely taking the card you want or the action you wanted or weren't prepared for. RoM seems a good game for those who might want to dabble in the marketplace at hand, reacting to the choices of other players and choosing simple strategies; however, players who successfully execute engine-building strategies and exploit special abilities will consistently outperform those players.

&amp;#x200B;

(This incarnation of) Reavers of Midgard is more of a Euro-style point-grab than its predecessor, with fewer ways to thwart your opponents' tactics than most. If you're looking for a points-race game where opponents can't perpetually trip each other up, then watch for this game to be Kickstarted in October.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a non-spoiler preview of the upcoming game from Grey Fox Games, &amp;quot;Reavers of Midgard&amp;quot;.

What I took from the game was:

* If I was to explain the game to a new group again, I would definately recomend a short tutorial (https://youtu.be/MrmFWOm6U0g is a great balance between duration and depth).

* Popularity is important, but not the only factor in winning. I managed to get up to 17 popularity, but as I did not have a large amount of territories I only managed a middle of the pack score.

* Coins can be important. The winning player chose the factory card which generates 3 coins, and then spammed the move. He ended up with 27 coins at the end of the game, which gave him the win by 10ish coins.

* You dont always have to win combat. Again the winning player spread out his units to control a large amount of territories, then once he was setup, used a tunnel to begin combat with the player who was closest to 5 stars. He then bid 0 combat power, giving the white player a star, and then the white player ended the game on their next go by placing their 4th building.

While I was there one of the guys had a game and I want to know the name so I can buy it and play it again.

Here are the few things I can remember about how it was played so.

It started with tiles in which you randomly placed to make a ""game board"" you then had multiple monsters that were made out of like cardboard that you added to a little plastic stand for them. And you placed them on the board that you made (anywhere if I remember correctly) then you had cards matching the monsters and you each drew a card (maybe 3 I think) and they matched monsters on the board but the other players didn't know who you had and then you each took turns moving the monsters one space at a time and if they met on the same square tile that monster ""died"" and was set aside untill only one was left and the goal was to try and keep the monster that matched your card alive till the end and then that person got the points for that round. Once someone won you could choose to move the tiles around to make a different looking map or ""game board"" also turn the cards back in and shuffle and grab new card. 

Few more details was I think the tiles that made up the game board were two sided. The tiles were also like some sort of dungeon. 2 players were the least but I know that when we played it we had 4 players I'm not sure if any more than that could play but I don't remember. 

I appreciate all the help anyone can give me THANKS!","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;So about 3 years or so ago I met up with some old friends from high school which I can no longer get ahold of. While I was there one of the guys had a game and I want to know the name so I can buy it and play it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the few things I can remember about how it was played so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It started with tiles in which you randomly placed to make a &amp;quot;game board&amp;quot; you then had multiple monsters that were made out of like cardboard that you added to a little plastic stand for them. And you placed them on the board that you made (anywhere if I remember correctly) then you had cards matching the monsters and you each drew a card (maybe 3 I think) and they matched monsters on the board but the other players didn&amp;#39;t know who you had and then you each took turns moving the monsters one space at a time and if they met on the same square tile that monster &amp;quot;died&amp;quot; and was set aside untill only one was left and the goal was to try and keep the monster that matched your card alive till the end and then that person got the points for that round. Once someone won you could choose to move the tiles around to make a different looking map or &amp;quot;game board&amp;quot; also turn the cards back in and shuffle and grab new card. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Few more details was I think the tiles that made up the game board were two sided. The tiles were also like some sort of dungeon. 2 players were the least but I know that when we played it we had 4 players I&amp;#39;m not sure if any more than that could play but I don&amp;#39;t remember. &lt;/p&gt;

Ok, so my turn 1: I get clank+2 and so I put my clank in the clank area but not in the bag.
Dragon attack: so now my clanks get put in the bag. That is clear.

Alternative turn 1: I get clank+1 and a clank -2 so I dont get to carry the extra -1 because the rules say you lose any unused -clanks at the end of you turn. Nothing goes in the area. That is clear too.

But, let's say turn 1: +2 clank. They go in the clank area but not in the bag as I've not had a dragon attack yet.
My Turn 2: I get -1 clank but don't generate any clank on that turn, can I use that -1 clank to get one of the clanks back from the clank area? It's not got in the bag yet as there hasn't been a dragon attack, and I'm not carrying my -clank over to the next go.

Don't think it changes the game hugely but I just had one of those ""shit, I wonder if I've been playing it wrong this whole time"" moments. It's not even a complicated book but I've lost the rulebook a while ago and only now started wondering!

Worst for me is from the review of Tom Vasel I bought First and Goal.  I'm a huge football and haven't found many games that work with that theme and aren't super bogged down simulations.  So I picked this up on his review.  It was pretty boring, just chucking dice with very very little thinking.  It was also anti thematic as breaking normal football tendencies is way more powerful than it actually should be making this into a guess fest.  

Best is also from Tom Vasel and it is New York Pizza Slice.

","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Welcome to &lt;a href=""/r/boardgames""&gt;/r/boardgames&lt;/a&gt; Daily Discussion and Game Recommendations&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is meant to be a place where you can ask any and all questions relating to the board gaming world: general or specific game recommendations, rule clarifications, definitions of terms/acronyms, and other quick questions that might not warrant their own post. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are seeking game recommendations you will get better responses if you give us enough background to help you. You can use &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template-no-explainer""&gt;this template&lt;/a&gt; to do so. &lt;a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/wiki/personalized-game-recommendation-template""&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a version with explanations of what we&amp;#39;re looking for.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you reply to any comment that has a game name in &lt;strong&gt;bold&lt;/strong&gt; with &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=""/u/r2d8""&gt;/u/r2d8&lt;/a&gt; getparentinfo&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;, one of our robots will tell you more about the game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just remember that this is a community full of awesome, helpful people, and feel free to ask your questions whatever they may be. As always, keep it civil and remember what the downvote button is actually for.&lt;/p&gt;

I have spent quite a bit on Kickstarter in the last five years, something to the tune of $6000 or $7000 over 169 projects. 

Just to be clear, this was all disposable income, so it didn't hurt me in any way. About 90% was on board games, the rest on tech and comics/graphic novels.

Looking over Starcadia Quest, I just felt plain old nothing. Not one ounce of me wanted to drop $120 on the ""base pledge"", i.e. the one that you really should get, since it comes with SO MUCH MORE COOL STUFF than the $80 actual base pledge. I already have retail Arcadia Quest and Inferno with all the goodies, now you want me to buy MORE???

I have so many games (\~200), and to be honest, my all time favorite games have almost never come from Kickstarter. What games do I rate a 9 or a 10? Games like Agricola/Caverna, Pandemic, Descent 2.0, Stone Age, Dominion, T'Zolkin, Glory to Rome, 7 Wonders: Duels, LOTR: LCG,  

I should note the few games that I have received from Kickstarter and were fantasic. Stonemeier Games really does come through, I'm almost sad Jamie has given up Kickstarter. I love Viticulture with Tuscany, Euphoria (for all of it's flaws), and Scythe. Between Two Cities is good, though not in the same tier as the three I mentioned.

King's Forge,  Eminent Domain, Evolution, Through the Ages (2nd Edition), Myth: Dark Frontier,  were also totally worth the purchase and the wait. The other 135ish board games? Honestly, I could probably do without them.

The issue might of course be me...I have a family, a toddler, two older kids that love playing games with me, but at 9 and 13 they can only do so much with the time we have together (every other weekend and one weeknight). When I do get together for games, it's not a 3 hour epic.

And yet, I purchased quite a few games that maybe I didn't need. Heck, I just backed Death May Die because I love the Mythos and things Cthulu.

I'm curious if anyone shares my current dislike of too much plastic on Kickstarter, if you find yourself buying games you might end up never playing, or if you just want to share your favorite games from Kickstarter.

Also, take away the lesson that Kickstarter will very rarely leave you content. There is ALWAYS something more to buy. There is ALWAYS another project with Kickstarter exclusives. I don't object to Kiskstarter as a whole, but at the end of the day it will work out in your favor to just wait for things to come to retail and be reviewed.

&amp;#x200B;

You know how many games CMON has put out that are critcally acclaimed? My anecdotal experience says just one: Blood Rage. The rest are just recycled dice chuckers with a ton of plastic to get you to buy. 

&amp;#x200B;

FYI, the big plastic games I have backed are:

&amp;#x200B;

Myth

Myth: Journeyman

Conan

Batman: Gotham City Chronicles

Arcadia Quest: Inferno

Rising Sun (Sold at cost)

Massive Darkness (Sold at cost)

Zombicide: Black Plague

Zombicide: Green Horde

Sword &amp; Sorcery

The Banner Saga: Warband

Dark Souls

Mythic Battles: Pantehon

Cthulu: Death May Die

&amp;#x200B;

You might count Scythe, Dungeons of Arcadia: Masmorra, Myth: Dark Frontier, Gloomhaven (enourmous, though not much plastic inside), if you feel so inclined.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I took a long look at the Starcadia Quest page, and came to the realization that I think I am just about done with backing board games with a huge amount of plastic on Kickstarter and cost over $100.

Ordered through Amazon from Amazon. Best option?**


I purchased Spirit Island through Amazon (initially thought GTG was the seller) and, after several plays, noticed a [misprinted card](https://imgur.com/a/t9DPd5n). 

If it wasn't an invader card it wouldn't be a big deal, but now I know those invaders want my sands and mountains and my poor, beautiful Dahan. I love my Dahan. Of course, I'm going to preempt that exploration if I can keep all of the moves straight in my head.

So, this card hasn't actually come up yet. I've only played the base difficulty and my friend and I typically take things down right before the level 3 invaders, but I know it's coming at some point. Per some other thread, I've emailed craig@greaterthangames with no reply yet (it's only been 5 days). 

* Will they replace the card? 
* Should I just return the whole thing to Amazon and order a new one even though this one has been played a few times?
* Is Branch and Claw that divisive?
* What's your favorite spirit from the base game?

These are the questions rattling in my mind. Unending. Dramatically. Invaderously.

To be clear, I'm using ""casual"" tournament to distinguish from something like the national Catan tournament at Origins.  A casual tournament is played entirely at a single convention. There are no qualifiers, so anyone who knows the rules to the game can play since the rules won't be taught. Games are usually spread out across the duration of the con, and joining a game does not require you to commit to any more games; you can play in just one round if you want.  Casual tournament games are usually listed in the event list alongside all the other scheduled games, but with a designation that this game counts for tournament scoring.  After all rounds have finished, the players with the highest win count are invited back for the semis/finals, and the final winner might get a plaque or something. No title, no status.  If you've ever been to WBC, this is the kind of tournament I'm talking about.

Having been to a few conventions with this tournament structure, it seems that different attendees have different reasons for signing up or not signing up for these tournament games. Some people say they don't like the ""tournament"" designation.  Some people like the competitive aspect, while others don't even care and just show up because it's on the schedule.  Others don't like scheduled games at all and prefer open gaming.  There seem to be many different expectations and assumptions for what these games are like.

So, what I'm curious to know is how this community feels about these kinds of games, whether you play in them or not.  If you've never heard of this before, consider- how would you feel about playing a familiar game at a convention knowing that it counted for a tournament and people are probably playing to win?  As mentioned earlier, playing in this game in no way forces you to participate in other tournament games.","&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;As someone who both attends conventions and sometimes runs them, I&amp;#39;m trying to get a better understanding for why some people join games that are part of casual tournaments and why others shy away.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm more talking about the practice of doing it, and whether there is money to be made / opinions about the ethics of doing so.

I recently received Zombicide: Green Horde and paid a total of $150 CAD after taxes and shipping.  When I received it, I was at a point where I really wanted to buy Twilight Imperium and/or Gloomhaven.  Looking at the prospect of a $400 investment for those 2 games, something had to go.  I turned around and sold the unopened Green Horde box for $260.  

I almost doubled my money for literally doing nothing. That kind of return on any investment is pretty staggering.  That being said, the game, like most kickstarters, took about a year to receive, so it was a bit of an investment.  

Now I'm wondering if this is worth doing in bulk.  There's an obvious risk to a game not being delivered, being delayed, or not being as good as expected.  But if you only invested in bigger companies' games like CMON it's a pretty surefire thing. 

I did some research into CMON games specifically and I see that Rising Sun lots have sold for over $400 for only a $100 investment.  Song Song of Ice and Fire The Miniatures Game lots have sold for $600+ for a $200 investment.

And the couple of times I did try, it was very energetic with lots of table talk, making it for a very fun game night.

So, I'm extremely happy to see that they are reprinting it (with some improvements). It's a bit unfortunate that it doesn't have the Discworld theme as I'm a huge fan of Sir Pratchett's work, but the gameplay alone was great for us, so I'm really looking forward to it.

**Description from Boardgamegeek**:

In his last will, your rich uncle stated that all of his millions will go to the nephew who can enjoy money the most. How to find out which nephew should be rich? You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance – oh, and win the game.

In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.

Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:


    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.
    Draw a card from any regular deck – This can be chosen only once by each player.
    Visit the opera and spend $2.
    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.
    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.


Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses – of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! – to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.

At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.

If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.

*Favorite games of your collection*

Mine are:

**Twilight Imperium** - great for 6 more serious games, this is the most epic game Ive played!

**Cosmic Encounter** - screams with replayability, promotes laughter.

**Whitehall Mystery** - when played with 4, this is coop at its finest.  Tense with lots of giggles and snickering.

**878 Vikings** - it's a 2v2 light war game... What more must I say?

Party games:

**Monikers** - tonnes of fun

**Telestrations** - drawings lost in translation... It's a blast

**Secret Hitler** - very deceptive and devious this game is great!


###The Bad
*Least favorite/games shunned to the depths of hell of your collection*

Mine are:

**Dead of Winter** - felt more like a gruelling chore than a game

**Pandemic** - too alphagamer/quarterbacking prone

**Risk 2210AD** - too reliant on the dice roll... After a 7 hour game we never want to play again when other much better games can we played

**Cards Against Humanity** - novelty aside, it's not particularly fun playing prewritten cards to prewritten prompts.  Monikers and Telestrations decimate this game.

**Coup** - this is a game which needs everyone to ""get it""... I dunno it fell flat :(

**Exploding Kittens** - just not very fun.  Sort of avoids any highs or any lows.

###The Ugly
*Unplayed games of your collection*

Mine are:

**Mafia de Cuba** - for next time I have a large group over

**Deception: Murder in Hong Kong** - likewise

**New Angeles** - 6 players is tough... For a whole day and beyond it's TI4, beyond that it's very difficult to decide between staying at 6 or bumping up to party games (especially with Deception and de Cuba to be played).  A longer more complex game, it isn't one to start when people begin leaving either.  I do seriously want to set a day around this game though!  It looks amazing!

**Battle For Rokugan** - when I want to play a game with 5 players that isn't **Cosmic Encounter** or **Mysterium** or even **New Angeles**

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Twilight Imperium&lt;/strong&gt; - great for 6 more serious games, this is the most epic game Ive played!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/strong&gt; - screams with replayability, promotes laughter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whitehall Mystery&lt;/strong&gt; - when played with 4, this is coop at its finest.  Tense with lots of giggles and snickering.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;878 Vikings&lt;/strong&gt; - it&amp;#39;s a 2v2 light war game... What more must I say?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Party games:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Monikers&lt;/strong&gt; - tonnes of fun&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Telestrations&lt;/strong&gt; - drawings lost in translation... It&amp;#39;s a blast&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Secret Hitler&lt;/strong&gt; - very deceptive and devious this game is great!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Bad&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Least favorite/games shunned to the depths of hell of your collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dead of Winter&lt;/strong&gt; - felt more like a gruelling chore than a game&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pandemic&lt;/strong&gt; - too alphagamer/quarterbacking prone&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Risk 2210AD&lt;/strong&gt; - too reliant on the dice roll... After a 7 hour game we never want to play again when other much better games can we played&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cards Against Humanity&lt;/strong&gt; - novelty aside, it&amp;#39;s not particularly fun playing prewritten cards to prewritten prompts.  Monikers and Telestrations decimate this game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Coup&lt;/strong&gt; - this is a game which needs everyone to &amp;quot;get it&amp;quot;... I dunno it fell flat :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exploding Kittens&lt;/strong&gt; - just not very fun.  Sort of avoids any highs or any lows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Ugly&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Unplayed games of your collection&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mine are:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Mafia de Cuba&lt;/strong&gt; - for next time I have a large group over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deception: Murder in Hong Kong&lt;/strong&gt; - likewise&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;New Angeles&lt;/strong&gt; - 6 players is tough... For a whole day and beyond it&amp;#39;s TI4, beyond that it&amp;#39;s very difficult to decide between staying at 6 or bumping up to party games (especially with Deception and de Cuba to be played).  A longer more complex game, it isn&amp;#39;t one to start when people begin leaving either.  I do seriously want to set a day around this game though!  It looks amazing!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Battle For Rokugan&lt;/strong&gt; - when I want to play a game with 5 players that isn&amp;#39;t &lt;strong&gt;Cosmic Encounter&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Mysterium&lt;/strong&gt; or even &lt;strong&gt;New Angeles&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Can you move the Raven to a location, to have it perform an action (say, to get 3 Power) then move Maleficent to that same location, then perform that same action?

We ask because it could be seen as Maleficent's turn, and therefore she only gets to perform each action at a location once.
